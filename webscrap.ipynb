      "Body: \n",
      "In this article, we’ll talk about different roles in a data team and discuss their responsibilities.\n",
      "In particular, we will cover:\n",

      "The responsibilities of each role;\n",
      "The skills and knowledge each role needs to have.\n",

      "\n",
      "This is not a comprehensive list and the majority of what you will read in this article is my opinion, which comes out of my experience from working as a data scientist.\n",
      "You can interpret the following information as “the description of data roles from the perspective of a data scientist”. For example, my views on the role of a data engineer may be a bit simplified because I don’t see all the complexities of their work firsthand. I do hope you will find this information useful nonetheless.\n",
      "Roles in a Team\n",
      "A typical data team consists of the following roles:\n",
      "\n",
      "Product managers,\n",
      "Data analysts,\n",
      "Data scientists,\n",
      "Data engineers,\n",
      "Machine learning engineers, and\n",
      "Site reliability engineers / MLOps engineers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The data team.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All these people work to create a data product.\n",
      "To explain the core responsibilities of each role, we will use a case scenario:\n",
      "Suppose we work at an online classifieds company. It’s a platform where users can go to sell things they don’t need (like OLX, where I work). If a user has an iPhone they want to sell — they go to this website, create a listing and sell their phone.\n",
      "On this platform, sellers sometimes have problems with identifying the correct category for the items they are selling. To help them, we want to build a service that suggests the best category. To sell their iPhone, the user creates a listing and the site needs to automatically understand that this iPhone has to go in the “mobile phones” category.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Use case: we want to build a service that automatically identifies the correct category for a listing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with the first role: product manager.\n",
      "Product Manager\n",
      "A product manager is someone responsible for developing products. Their goal is to make sure that the team is building the right thing. They are typically less technical than the rest of the team: they don’t focus on the implementation aspects of a problem, but rather the problem itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A product manager makes sure the team builds a product that users will use.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Product managers need to ensure that the product is actually used by the end-users. This is a common problem: in many companies, engineers create something that doesn’t solve real problems. Therefore, the product manager is somebody who speaks to the team on behalf of the users.\n",
      "The primary skills a PM needs to have are communication skills. For data scientists, communication is a soft skill, but for a product manager — it’s a hard skill. They have to have it to perform their work.\n",
      "Product managers also do a lot of planning: they need to understand the problem, come up with a solution, and make sure the solution is implemented in a timely manner. To accomplish this, PMs need to know what’s important and plan the work accordingly.\n",
      "When somebody has a problem, they approach the PM with it. Then the task of the PM is to figure out if users actually need this feature, how important this feature is, and if the team has the capacity to implement it.\n",
      "Let’s come back to our example. Suppose somebody comes to the PM and says:\n",
      "“We want to build a feature to automatically suggest the category for a listing. Somebody’s selling an iPhone, and we want to create a service that predicts that the item goes in the mobile phones category.”\n",
      "Product managers need to answer these questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is this feature that important to the user?”\n",
      "“Is it an important problem to solve in the product at all?”\n",
      "\n",
      "To answer these questions, PMs ask data analysts to help them figure out what to do next.\n",
      "Data Analyst\n",
      "Data analysts know how to analyze the data available in the company. They discover insights in the data and then explain their findings to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts discover insights in data.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, analysts need to know:\n",
      "\n",
      "What kind of data the company has;\n",
      "How to get the data;\n",
      "How to interpret the results;\n",
      "How to explain their findings to colleagues and management.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data analysts are also often responsible for defining key metrics and building different dashboards. This includes things like showing the company’s profits, displaying the number of listings, or how many contacts buyers made with sellers.  Thus, data analysts should know how to calculate all the important business metrics, and how to present them in a way that is understandable to others.\n",
      "When it comes to skills, data analysts should know:\n",
      "\n",
      "SQL — this is the main tool that they work with;\n",
      "Programming languages such as Python or R;\n",
      "Tableau or similar tools for building dashboards;\n",
      "Basics of statistics;\n",
      "How to run experiments;\n",
      "A bit of machine learning, such as regression analysis, and time series modeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our example, product managers turn to data analysts to help them quantify the extent of the problem. Together with the PM, the data analyst tries to answer questions like:\n",
      "\n",
      "“How many users are affected by this problem?”\n",
      "“How many users don’t finish creating their listing because of this problem?”\n",
      "“How many listings are there on the platform that don’t have the right category selected?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The PM turns to the analyst to understand the extent of the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After the analyst gets the data, analyzes it and answers these questions, they may conclude: “Yes, this is actually a problem”. Then the PM and the team discuss the repost and agree: “Indeed, this problem is actually worth solving”.\n",
      "Now the data team will go ahead and start solving this problem.\n",
      "After the model for the service is created, it’s necessary to understand if the service is effective: whether this model helps people and solves the problem. For that, data analysts usually run experiments — usually, A/B tests.\n",
      "When running an experiment, we can see if more users successfully finish posting an item for sale or if there are fewer ads that end up in the wrong category.\n",
      "Data Scientist\n",
      "The roles of a data scientist and data analyst are pretty similar. In some companies, it’s the same person who does both jobs. However, data scientists typically focus more on predicting rather than explaining.\n",
      "A data analyst fetches the data, looks at it, explains what’s going on to the team, and gives some recommendations on what to do about it. A data scientist, on the other hand, focuses more on creating machine learning services. For example, one of the questions that a data scientist would want to answer is “How can we use this data to build a machine learning model for predicting something?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Data scientists create machine learning services.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, data scientists incorporate the data into the product. Their focus is more on engineering than analysis. Data scientists work more closely with engineers on integrating data solutions into the product.\n",
      "The skills of data scientists include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine learning — the main tool for building predictive services;\n",
      "Python — the primary programming language;\n",
      "SQL — necessary to fetch the data for training their models;\n",
      "Flask, Docker, and similar — to create simple web services for serving the models.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our example, the data scientists are the people who develop the model used for predicting the category. Once they have a model, they can develop a simple web service for hosting this model.\n",
      "Data Engineers\n",
      "Data engineers do all the heavy lifting when it comes to data. A lot of work needs to happen before data analysts can go to a database, fetch the data, perform their analysis, and come up with a report. This is precisely the focus of data engineers — they make sure this is possible. Their responsibility is to prepare all the necessary data in a form that is consumable for their colleagues.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Data engineers make the data available for data analysts and data scientists.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To accomplish this, data engineers create “a data lake”. All the data that users generate needs to be captured properly and saved in a separate database. This way, analysts can run their analysis, and data scientists can use this data for training models.\n",
      "Another thing data engineers often need to do, especially at larger companies, is to ensure that the people who look at the data have the necessary clearance to do so. Some user data is sensitive and people can’t just go looking around at personal information (such as emails or phone numbers) unless they have a really good reason to do so. Therefore, data engineers need to set up a system that doesn’t let people just access all the data at once.\n",
      "The skills needed for data engineers usually include:\n",
      "\n",
      "AWS or Google Cloud — popular cloud providers;\n",
      "Kubernetes and Terraform — infrastructure tools;\n",
      "Kafka or RabbitMQ — tools for capturing and processing the data;\n",
      "Databases — to save the data in such a way that it’s accessible for data analysts;\n",
      "Airflow or Luigi — data orchestration tools for building complex data pipelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our example, a data engineer prepares all the required data. First, they make sure the analyst has the data to perform the analysis. Then they also work with the data scientist to prepare the information that we’ll need for training the model. That includes the title of the listing, its description, the category, and so on.\n",
      "A data engineer isn’t the only type of engineer that a data team has. There are also machine learning engineers.\n",
      "Machine Learning Engineer\n",
      "Machine learning engineers take whatever data scientists build and help them scale it up. They also ensure that the service is maintainable and that the team follows the best engineering practices. Their focus is more on engineering than on modeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine learning engineers help data scientists put the model into production.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The skills ML engineers have are similar to that of data engineers:\n",
      "\n",
      "AWS or Google Cloud;\n",
      "Infrastructure tools like Kubernetes and Terraform;\n",
      "Python and other programming languages;\n",
      "Flask, Docker, and other tools for creating web services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, ML engineers work closely with more “traditional” engineers, like backend engineers, frontend engineers, or mobile engineers, to ensure that the services from the data team are included in the final product.\n",
      "For our example, ML engineers work together with data scientists on productionizing the category suggestion services. They make sure it’s stable once it’s rolled out to all the users. They must also ensure that it’s maintainable and it’s possible to make changes to the service in the future.\n",
      "There’s another kind of engineer that can be pretty important in a data team — site reliability engineers.\n",
      "DevOps / Site Reliability Engineer\n",
      "The role of SREs is similar to the ML engineer, but the focus is more on the availability and reliability of the services.\n",
      "SREs aren’t strictly limited to working with data. Their role is more general: they tend to focus less on business logic and more on infrastructure, which includes things like networking and provisioning infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "SREs take care of the infrastructure and make sure the services work reliably.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, SREs look after the servers where the services are running and take care of collecting all the operational metrics like CPU usage, how many requests per second there are, the services’ processes, and so on.\n",
      "As the name suggests, site reliability engineers have to make sure that everything runs reliably. They set up alerts and are constantly on call to make sure that the services are up and running without any interruptions. If something breaks, SREs quickly diagnose the problem and fix it, or involve an engineer to help find the solution.\n",
      "The skills needed for site reliability engineers:\n",
      "\n",
      "Cloud infrastructure tools;\n",
      "Programming languages like Python,\n",
      "Unix/Linux;\n",
      "Networking;\n",
      "Best DevOps practices like automation, CI/CD, and the like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, ML engineers and data engineers should also know these best practices, but the focus of DevOps engineers/SREs is to establish them and make sure that they are followed.\n",
      "There is a special type of DevOps engineer, called “MLOps engineer”.\n",
      "MLOps Engineer\n",
      "An MLOps engineer is a DevOps engineer who also knows the basics of machine learning. Similar to an SRE, the responsibility of an MLOps Engineer is to make sure that the services, developed by data scientists, ML engineers, and data engineers, are up and running all the time.\n",
      "MLOps engineers know the lifecycle of a machine learning model: the training phase, serving phase, and so on.\n",
      "Despite having this knowledge, MLOps Engineers are still focused more on operational support than on anything else. This means that they need to know and follow all the DevOps practices and make sure that the rest of the team is following them as well. They accomplish this by setting up things like continuous retraining, and CI/CD pipelines.\n",
      "Even though everyone in the team has a different focus, they all work together on achieving the same goal: solve the problems of the users.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "To summarize, the roles in the data team and their responsibilities are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Product managers — make sure that the team is building the right thing, act as a gateway to all the requests and speak on behalf of the users.\n",
      "Data analysts — analyze data, define key metrics, and create dashboards.\n",
      "Data scientists — build models and incorporate them into the product.\n",
      "Data engineers — prepare the data for analysts and data scientists.\n",
      "ML engineers — productionize machine learning services and establish the best engineering practices.\n",
      "Site reliability engineers — focus on availability, reliability, enforce the best DevOps practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "This list is not comprehensive, but it should be a good starting point if you are just getting into the industry, or if you just want to know how the lines between different roles are defined in the industry.\n",

Together with the PM, the data analyst tries to answer questions like:\\n\\n“How many users are affected by this problem?”\\n“How many users don’t finish creating their listing because of this problem?”\\n“How many listings are there on the platform that don’t have the right category selected?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe PM turns to the analyst to understand the extent of the problem.\\n\\n\\nAfter the analyst gets the data, analyzes it and answers these questions, they may conclude: “Yes, this is actually a problem”. Then the PM and the team discuss the repost and agree: “Indeed, this problem is actually worth solving”.\\nNow the data team will go ahead and start solving this problem.\\nAfter the model for the service is created, it’s necessary to understand if the service is effective: whether this model helps people and solves the problem. For that, data analysts usually run experiments — usually, A/B tests.\\nWhen running an experiment, we can see if more users successfully finish posting an item for sale or if there are fewer ads that end up in the wrong category.\\nData Scientist\\nThe roles of a data scientist and data analyst are pretty similar. In some companies, it’s the same person who does both jobs. However, data scientists typically focus more on predicting rather than explaining.\\nA data analyst fetches the data, looks at it, explains what’s going on to the team, and gives some recommendations on what to do about it. A data scientist, on the other hand, focuses more on creating machine learning services. For example, one of the questions that a data scientist would want to answer is “How can we use this data to build a machine learning model for predicting something?”\\n\\n\\n\\nData scientists create machine learning services.\\n\\n\\nIn other words, data scientists incorporate the data into the product. Their focus is more on engineering than analysis. Data scientists work more closely with engineers on integrating data solutions into the product.\\nThe skills of data scientists include:\\n\\nMachine learning — the main tool for building predictive services;\\nPython — the primary programming language;\\nSQL — necessary to fetch the data for training their models;\\nFlask, Docker, and similar — to create simple web services for serving the models.\\n\\nFor our example, the data scientists are the people who develop the model used for predicting the category. Once they have a model, they can develop a simple web service for hosting this model.\\nData Engineers\\nData engineers do all the heavy lifting when it comes to data. A lot of work needs to happen before data analysts can go to a database, fetch the data, perform their analysis, and come up with a report. This is precisely the focus of data engineers — they make sure this is possible. Their responsibility is to prepare all the necessary data in a form that is consumable for their colleagues.\\n\\n\\n\\nData engineers make the data available for data analysts and data scientists.\\n\\n\\nTo accomplish this, data engineers create “a data lake”. All the data that users generate needs to be captured properly and saved in a separate database. This way, analysts can run their analysis, and data scientists can use this data for training models.\\nAnother thing data engineers often need to do, especially at larger companies, is to ensure that the people who look at the data have the necessary clearance to do so. Some user data is sensitive and people can’t just go looking around at personal information (such as emails or phone numbers) unless they have a really good reason to do so. Therefore, data engineers need to set up a system that doesn’t let people just access all the data at once.\\nThe skills needed for data engineers usually include:\\n\\nAWS or Google Cloud — popular cloud providers;\\nKubernetes and Terraform — infrastructure tools;\\nKafka or RabbitMQ — tools for capturing and processing the data;\\nDatabases — to save the data in such a way that it’s accessible for data analysts;\\nAirflow or Luigi — data orchestration tools for building complex data pipelines.\\n\\nIn our example, a data engineer prepares all the required data. First, they make sure the analyst has the data to perform the analysis. Then they also work with the data scientist to prepare the information that we’ll need for training the model. That includes the title of the listing, its description, the category, and so on.\\nA data engineer isn’t the only type of engineer that a data team has. There are also machine learning engineers.\\nMachine Learning Engineer\\nMachine learning engineers take whatever data scientists build and help them scale it up. They also ensure that the service is maintainable and that the team follows the best engineering practices. Their focus is more on engineering than on modeling.\\n\\n\\n\\nMachine learning engineers help data scientists put the model into production.\\n\\n\\nThe skills ML engineers have are similar to that of data engineers:\\n\\nAWS or Google Cloud;\\nInfrastructure tools like Kubernetes and Terraform;\\nPython and other programming languages;\\nFlask, Docker, and other tools for creating web services.\\n\\nAdditionally, ML engineers work closely with more “traditional” engineers, like backend engineers, frontend engineers, or mobile engineers, to ensure that the services from the data team are included in the final product.\\nFor our example, ML engineers work together with data scientists on productionizing the category suggestion services. They make sure it’s stable once it’s rolled out to all the users. They must also ensure that it’s maintainable and it’s possible to make changes to the service in the future.\\nThere’s another kind of engineer that can be pretty important in a data team — site reliability engineers.\\nDevOps / Site Reliability Engineer\\nThe role of SREs is similar to the ML engineer, but the focus is more on the availability and reliability of the services.\\nSREs aren’t strictly limited to working with data. Their role is more general: they tend to focus less on business logic and more on infrastructure, which includes things like networking and provisioning infrastructure.\\n\\n\\n\\nSREs take care of the infrastructure and make sure the services work reliably.\\n\\n\\nTherefore, SREs look after the servers where the services are running and take care of collecting all the operational metrics like CPU usage, how many requests per second there are, the services’ processes, and so on.\\nAs the name suggests, site reliability engineers have to make sure that everything runs reliably. They set up alerts and are constantly on call to make sure that the services are up and running without any interruptions. If something breaks, SREs quickly diagnose the problem and fix it, or involve an engineer to help find the solution.\\nThe skills needed for site reliability engineers:\\n\\nCloud infrastructure tools;\\nProgramming languages like Python,\\nUnix/Linux;\\nNetworking;\\nBest DevOps practices like automation, CI/CD, and the like.\\n\\nOf course, ML engineers and data engineers should also know these best practices, but the focus of DevOps engineers/SREs is to establish them and make sure that they are followed.\\nThere is a special type of DevOps engineer, called “MLOps engineer”.\\nMLOps Engineer\\nAn MLOps engineer is a DevOps engineer who also knows the basics of machine learning. Similar to an SRE, the responsibility of an MLOps Engineer is to make sure that the services, developed by data scientists, ML engineers, and data engineers, are up and running all the time.\\nMLOps engineers know the lifecycle of a machine learning model: the training phase, serving phase, and so on.\\nDespite having this knowledge, MLOps Engineers are still focused more on operational support than on anything else. This means that they need to know and follow all the DevOps practices and make sure that the rest of the team is following them as well. They accomplish this by setting up things like continuous retraining, and CI/CD pipelines.\\nEven though everyone in the team has a different focus, they all work together on achieving the same goal: solve the problems of the users.\\nSummary\\nTo summarize, the roles in the data team and their responsibilities are:\\n\\nProduct managers — make sure that the team is building the right thing, act as a gateway to all the requests and speak on behalf of the users.\\nData analysts — analyze data, define key metrics, and create dashboards.\\nData scientists — build models and incorporate them into the product.\\nData engineers — prepare the data for analysts and data scientists.\\nML engineers — productionize machine learning services and establish the best engineering practices.\\nSite reliability engineers — focus on availability, reliability, enforce the best DevOps practices.\\n\\nThis list is not comprehensive, but it should be a good starting point if you are just getting into the industry, or if you just want to know how the lines between different roles are defined in the industry.\\n\\nThis article is based on the podcast “Roles in a data team”.

Companies are looking for data scientists to help them make better decisions, drive growth, and improve operational efficiency. But building a data science team from scratch can be a challenge. In this article, we’ll explore some tips on how to build an effective data science team.\\nThe article is organized as follows:\\n\\nhow to start building a data science team\\nspecialists vs generalists\\nwho to hire first\\nwhat is a strong product team\\nmotivating team to write articles and contribute to open source\\npicking the next projects to work on.\\n\\nHow to start building a data science team\\nThere are two ways to start building a data team, as shown in the following figure:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDefining a project and then starting recruiting — In this case, you should start with the following questions: What problems are you trying to solve? What kind of data do you need to build your project? Answering these questions will help you determine the skillsets and expertise you need on your team. Once you have an idea of the team you need, it’s time to start recruiting.\\n\\n\\nStarting immediately hiring and then defining a project — In this case, you start the recruiting campaign, and then define the project.\\n\\n\\nIndeed, there is no solution better than the other. In fact, some companies firstly define the project and then start hiring, and other companies that do exactly the opposite. A good trade-off could be a combination of both, in the sense that you could start from a vision, which defines what the end goal should be, but the final product is still unclear.\\nAlthough you could have in your mind your final goal, you may not know which features will lead to the final product. For this reason, you could start hiring different roles that would take you to that point to get a better understanding of your vision.\\nThe best way to find talented data scientists is through referrals from people you trust. Attend meetups and conferences related to data science and big data, and post job listings on relevant online communities and forums.\\nOnce you have a few candidates, it’s important to evaluate their skillset carefully. In addition to technical ability, you want to make sure they have strong communication skills and are able to work well in a team environment. The best way to assess these skills is through coding challenges and interviews that test both their technical abilities and soft skills.\\nBuilding a data team can be a challenge, but it’s definitely doable with careful planning and execution. By keeping these tips in mind, you’ll be well on your way\\nSpecialists vs generalists\\nWhen you start hiring, you may search for two types of profiles, as shown in the following figure:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngeneralists — professionals who have a general knowledge of all the Data Science workflow, from project setup to project deployment, but they do not have specific knowledge of the single steps of the Data Science workflow.\\n\\n\\nspecialists — professionals who have specific knowledge of a single step of the Data Science workflow, but do not know the general Data Science workflow.\\n\\n\\nIf you decide to hire specialists, you’ll need to make sure that each team member is able to work together and share their knowledge. This can be a challenge, but if you have the right mix of people it can lead to a very strong team. The advantage of this approach is that each team member will be an expert in their own area and they’ll be able to bring a lot of knowledge to the table.\\nIf you decide to go with a team of generalists, the advantage of this approach is that everyone will have a good understanding of the whole data science process.\\nIn a startup, you should hire first generalists — people who can do pretty much everything. In fact, when you start, you have no lines of code. There’s nothing, which means you need to do back end, front end, DevOps, and whatever.\\nInstead, if your company is already stable, probably you need more specialists, who focus on specific problems, such as tuning hyperparameters of a Machine Learning model.\\nAs your company grows, you may begin hiring more and more specialists and fewer generalists.\\nWho to hire first\\nWhen building a data science team, it can be difficult to decide who to hire first. The answer, of course, depends on your specific needs.\\nBut in general, we recommend hiring first the following three profiles, as shown in the following figure:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMachine Learning engineers or Software engineers with Machine Learning skills.\\n\\n\\nData engineers, that build and maintain the systems that collect and store all that data.\\n\\n\\nProduct managers, that prioritize the work to do.\\n\\n\\nAt the beginning, you need people who can work on the prototype, who will write a lot of coding, and who will work on the product. It doesn’t make sense for you to hire a UX/UI designer when you have no work for them.\\nOf course, every team is different, and you may find that you need to hire a different combination of roles depending on your unique circumstances. So you really need to understand, at which stage you are. And what kind of roles do you need now to solve this problem.\\nWhat is a strong product team\\nTo build a strong product team, it is important to first understand what a product team is. A product team is responsible for the development and management of a company’s products. This includes everything from the initial idea and conception of the product, to its design, production, and eventual distribution.\\nA strong product team is a team that is building a product that the customer wants. Strong means:\\n\\n\\nvery customer-centric\\n\\n\\ndelivering features very fast\\n\\n\\ntesting these things out with customers very fast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn other words, a strong product team will have a clear understanding of the market they are targeting and will work together to ensure that the final product meets the needs of their target audience. In order to build a strong product team, it is important to have a clear vision for the product and to assemble a team of individuals with the skills and experience necessary to bring that vision to fruition.\\nMotivating team to write articles and contribute to open source\\nData science is a collaborative field, and one of the best ways to learn and improve your skills is to share your knowledge with others. Writing blog posts and articles is a great way to do this, and it can also be a good motivator for your team.\\nYou should encourage your team members to write articles about their work and provide them with any resources they need to get started. You can also offer incentives for writing articles, such as bonus points or rewards.\\nContributing to open-source projects is another great way for your team to learn and improve their skills. You could even encourage your team members to find projects they’re interested in and contribute their time and expertise. Again, you can offer incentives for open source contributions, such as bonus points or rewards.\\nHiring a data scientist\\nWhen it comes to building a data science team, one of the most important things to consider is hiring a data scientist. While there are many different ways to go about this, there are a few key things to keep in mind.\\nFirst, it’s important to find someone with the right skillset. You can look at the candidate curriculum. A data scientist should be able to not only analyze data, but also understand how to use that data to solve real-world problems. Additionally, they should be well-versed in statistics and modeling, and be able to communicate their findings effectively.\\nOnce you’ve found a few candidates with the right skillset, it’s important to interview them thoroughly. In addition to questions about their experience and qualifications, be sure to ask them about their approach to data science and how they would go about solving a specific problem. This will help you get a better sense of their thought process and whether or not they would be a good fit for your team.\\nThe interview should also include questions on personal experiences, to check whether that person is interesting or not. If someone is just plain boring, this is very difficult for the team. That person also needs a hobby, such as going to the cinema, doing some sports, or whatever. But that person needs to do something. You work more time with that person than you spend with your girlfriend or your wife. You spend more time with them than with the person that you love. So that’s why you need to understand that person really well.\\nYou could also include a second interview, which could be a homework assignment. You could send out some homework, which is not very difficult. Then the candidate sends you the code, whether it is Jupyter Notebook or whatever. Then you should check it. From this simple task, you could already see how much people are working.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPicking the next projects to work on\\nThere are a lot of data science projects out there, and it can be tough to decide which ones to tackle next. Here are a few things to keep in mind when choosing projects:\\n\\n\\nConsider the impact of the project. Will it make a big difference for your company or customers?\\n\\n\\nThink about the difficulty of the project. Is it something you and your team are confident you can handle?\\n\\n\\nTake into account the resources you have available. Do you have the time and budget to dedicate to this project?\\n\\n\\nLastly, don’t forget to have some fun! Data science is supposed to be enjoyable, so pick projects that seem interesting and exciting to you and your team.\\n\\n\\nSummary\\nCongratulations! You have just learned some tips on how to build a data science team!\\nData science is a rapidly growing field, and it can be difficult to build an effective data science team. However, by following the advice in this article, you can create a team that is well-equipped to tackle your data science projects.\\nWhen building a data science team, it is important to consider the skills and experience of each team member. The team should have a mix of technical and non-technical skills, as well as a variety of domain expertise. In addition, the team should be able to work together collaboratively to solve complex problems.\\nOnce you have assembled your team, you need to provide them with the resources they need to be successful. This includes access to data, computing power, and software tools. In addition, you need to create an environment that encourages creativity and collaboration.\\nBy following these tips, you can build a data science team that is poised for success!\\nHappy Data Science!\\nThe content of this article has been inspired by the podcast episode Building a Data Science Team with Dat Tran at DataTalks.Club.\\n', 'url': 'https://datatalks.club/blog/building-data-science-team.html'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Data Science Manager vs Data Science Expert', 'body': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto by krakenimages on Unsplash\\nThere’s a lot of debate in the tech world about whether data science managers or data science experts are more valuable to organizations. Some believe that managers are better able to develop and implement strategy, while others argue that experts are more skilled at working with data.\\nSo, which is it? In this article, we’ll explore the pros and cons of each option to help you make a decision for your organization.\\nThe article is organized as follows:\\n\\n\\nThe roles of manager and expert\\n\\n\\nDo you need a manager or an expert?\\n\\n\\nSkills\\n\\n\\nResponsibilities\\n\\n\\nWorking in a team\\n\\n\\nDo you need a manager or an expert?\\n\\n\\nThe roles of manager and expert\\nThe expert role is different from the manager’s because experts need a very deep understanding of algorithms and technologies from the area in which they have many years of experience, while managers only have a general knowledge of the topic. Very often, an expert doesn’t only have a good knowledge of technology, but also domain knowledge.\\nData science managers are responsible for a team of data scientists and ensuring that projects are completed on time and within budget. They also work with clients to understand their needs and ensure that the team is meeting their expectations.\\nData science experts are responsible for providing insights and recommendations based on data analysis. They also develop and test models to improve decision-making and help businesses solve complex problems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkills\\nThere are a number of requirements that data science managers need to be aware of, both technical and non-technical. On the technical side, they need to have a good understanding of the various data science tools and techniques available, as well as how to use them effectively. They also need to be able to understand and interpret the results of data science experiments and provide feedback to the team.\\nNon-technical requirements for data science managers include good communication and interpersonal skills, as well as project management experience. They need to be able to work with different teams within an organization and be able to manage multiple projects simultaneously.\\nAs a data science manager, it is important to also have technical skills. It is important to understand how it works but on a high level. This allows you to better understand the work your team is doing and to provide more effective guidance. Additionally, technical skills can help you build credibility with your team and improve your ability to troubleshoot issues.\\nData science experts are often highly technical individuals with deep knowledge in a particular area. While this expertise can be invaluable, it is not always necessary for data science managers. In many cases, general management skills and an understanding of data science principles are sufficient.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResponsibilities\\nThe responsibilities of a data science manager involve:\\n\\n\\nleading and coordinating a team of data scientists\\n\\n\\ndeveloping data science strategies\\n\\n\\noverseeing projects from start to finish\\n\\n\\ndirecting the personal development of each team member.\\n\\n\\nManagers have a holistic approach to data science projects. They don’t only know and use technologies and models, but they also communicate with stakeholders and business users. They understand all the requirements of the machine learning models very well and how they will be used by business users. With this holistic approach, they should be able to identify new opportunities to leverage data science in various business areas.\\nAs a data science manager, you will be responsible for developing and managing a team of data scientists. In addition to overseeing the work of your team, you will also be involved in business development and sales. This means that you will need to have strong communication and presentation skills. You will also need to be able to negotiate deals with clients and partners.\\nData science experts, on the other hand, are responsible for executing data science projects. They possess in-depth knowledge of algorithms and statistical techniques and are able to wrangle large data sets. They also have strong communication skills, which are essential for collaborating with other members of the data science team.\\nAs a data science expert, you will be responsible for conducting research and developing new techniques and methods for data analysis. You will also be involved in the implementation of these techniques into projects. In addition to your technical expertise, you will also need to have strong communication and presentation skills.\\nWorking in a team\\nAs a data science manager, one of your primary responsibilities is to develop and manage a team of data scientists. This includes hiring talented individuals, providing them with the resources they need to do their job effectively, and setting clear expectations. Additionally, you need to ensure that your team is working together harmoniously and effectively towards common goals.\\nAs a data science manager, it’s important to be able to check your team’s work and make sure that they are on the right track. This means being able to understand the data and the analysis that they are doing. If you aren’t able to do this, then it will be difficult to manage the team and make sure that they are productive. A data science manager should also tell each member which direction he or she should take and tell them what the goals for the year or for the month are.\\nData science experts are often able to provide insights and suggestions that can help improve the work of the data science team. In addition, data science experts are often able to build strong teams because of their deep understanding of the field. They know what skills and knowledge are necessary for success and can identify talented individuals. Data science managers, on the other hand, may not have the same level of expertise. While they may be able to identify potential team members, they may not have the ability to fully assess their skills and knowledge.\\nDo you need a manager or an expert?\\nThe answer to this question may depend on the size and scope of your project.\\nIf you have a large project with many moving parts, then you might need a data science manager to keep everything organized and on track. A manager can also be helpful in coordinating team members with different skill sets.\\nOn the other hand, if your project is more focused and you have a clear idea of what you want to achieve, then you might be better off working with a data science expert. An expert can help you fine-tune your project and ensure success.\\nUltimately, the decision of whether to work with a manager or an expert depends on your specific needs and goals. If you are unsure, it might be helpful to consult with both types of professionals to get a sense of what would work best for your project.\\nAnyway, you should keep in mind that if you hire first a data science manager, then the manager would basically build a data science team.\\nSummary\\nCongratulations! You have just learned the difference between data science manager and data science expert!\\nData science managers are responsible for leading teams of data scientists and ensuring that projects are completed on time and within budget. They also need to have general technical skills and be able to effectively communicate results to non-technical stakeholders. Data science experts, on the other hand, are responsible for actually doing the work of data analysis and modeling. They need to have a deep understanding of statistics and machine learning and be able to effectively communicate their findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.\\nSo, which role is right for you? If you feel like you have the leadership skills necessary to manage a team of data scientists, then a data science manager might be the right choice. If you’d rather focus on the actual work of data science, then a data science expert might be a better fit.\\nUltimately, it’s up to you to decide which role best suits your job!\\nThe content of this article has been inspired by the podcast episode Data Science Manager vs Data Science Expert with Barbara Sobkowiak at DataTalks.Club.\\n', 'url': 'https://datatalks.club/blog/data-science-manager-vs-data-science-expert.html'}\n",
      "{'title': \"Data Engineers Aren't Plumbers\", 'body': '\\n\\n\\nWater pipes (Photo by LoggaWiggler on Pixabay)\\n\\nEvery time we open an article with a title similar to “What is a data engineer?” or “The difference between data engineer and data scientist” we get a cliche answer: Data engineers are like plumbers.\\nNo! No! No! That is wrong. A data engineer can work with pipelines like a plumber but the role is very different.\\nIn this article, I will show you that a data engineer is similar to another profession/job: hydraulic and water resources engineer.\\nI will explain why in three simple arguments:\\n\\nWorking titles;\\nTask goals;\\nTools needed to develop work.\\n\\n1. The titles are the same\\nWell, this is obvious, right? 🙂 They are both engineers.\\n\\n\\nMathematics (Photo by ArtsyBee on Pixabay)\\n\\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, an engineer is “someone who designs, builds or maintains engines, machines, or structures”.\\nEach role may focus on different resources/products/processes, “water” for hydraulic and water resources engineers, and “data” for data engineers but both handle engineering on it.\\nThey are more “thinking” roles than “manual” roles (like a plumber) since they have to reflect and calculate what are the best solutions for their processes and not act by simple guidelines.\\n2. Both have similar working goals\\nThis section is similar to the previous but we are focusing on the goal of each engineer.\\nFor example, a mechanical engineer has the working scope to build, maintain and improve mechanical machines that will perform some tasks.\\nI’m considering a data engineer has the objective of building, maintaining, and improving data pipelines (ETL or ELT processes), data storage structures (data warehouses or data lakes), and providing solid data to the stakeholders.\\nIn a detailed way, the professional has the working scope of guarantee the a) extraction of data from various sources (both internal like relational databases and external sources), b) transformation of data using solid programming skills or software, c) good organization of the data in the correct storage structures and d) quality/organization of all the end-to-end processes and data using orchestrator tools, monitoring tools or other control tools.\\nA data engineer needs to think of the process as a whole considering downstream and upstream mechanisms.\\n\\n\\nWater Treatment plant (Photo by Marcin Jozwiak on Pexels)\\n\\nThe specialization of Hydraulic and Water Resources Engineering by the McGill University of Canada describes these two disciplines as follows:\\n“Water resources engineering is the quantitative study of the hydrologic cycle — the distribution and circulation of water linking the earth’s atmosphere, land and oceans. (…) Applications include the management of the urban water supply, the design of urban storm-sewer systems, and flood forecasting.” and “Hydraulic engineering consists of the application of fluid mechanics to water flowing in an isolated environment (pipe, pump) or in an open channel (river, lake, ocean). Applications include the design of hydraulic structures, such as sewage conduits, dams and breakwaters, the management of waterways, such as erosion protection and flood protection, and environmental management, such as prediction of the mixing and transport of pollutants in surface water.”.\\nTherefore I’m considering hydraulic and water resources engineers need to guarantee (besides other tasks)\\na) the extraction of water from various sources,\\nb) the correct water cleaning in water treatment facilities (see image above),\\nc) good organization of the water in the correct storage structures, and\\nd) quality/organization of all the end-to-end processes with several control tools.\\nIn the table below it is possible to see how identical both roles are in terms of working processes, tasks, or goals (with some examples).\\n\\n\\n\\nProcesses/Task/Scope\\nData Engineer\\nHydraulic and Water Resources Engineer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExtraction of raw product from sources\\nRelational databases, External API, or CRM data.\\nSurface water, groundwater, or wastewater.\\n\\n\\nDevelopment and maintain transformation processes\\nData transformation by cleaning, deduplication, or data type correction.\\nWater cleaning by removing organic compounds, or non-organic compounds.\\n\\n\\nDevelopment and maintain storage structure\\nData warehouse, data Lakes.\\nWater towers, water dams.\\n\\n\\nDevelopment of the full process construction\\nData orchestration tools.\\nComputer tools to draw all systems, and wastewater treatment plants.\\n\\n\\nControlling/Monitoring processes and product\\nSoftware tools for data lineage or process control\\nSensors all over the process\\n\\n\\nStakeholders\\nData analysts, Data Scientists.\\nCities, industrial.\\n\\n\\n\\nTherefore you can see that even having different targets both engineers do similar tasks.\\n3. They use identical tools\\nIn that cliché of “data engineer equals plumber” it is often written that both have tools. However, the plumber tools are different from the data engineer tools. But both data engineers and hydraulic and water resources engineers use similar tools.\\nConsidering the processes present in the table above I will present you some examples for each role.\\nFor data engineers:\\n\\nSQL for analysis of the data sources;\\nPython, Scala or other programming languages for development.\\nAirflow, Luigi or other for the development of the full process construction\\nGrafana and data testing tools to control and monitor.\\n\\nFor hydraulic and water resources engineer:\\n\\nTools for geo analysis or GIS tools for analysis of the sources area;\\nExcel or similar tool for calculus;\\nCAD software tools for the development of the full process construction;\\nSensors for quality and quantity water control.\\n\\nSo all the tools for both engineers are complex tools (mostly software) with the purpose of proceeding to the estimation of the best solution. They are not manual tools like hammers.\\nConclusion\\nIn summary it was presented in three simple subjects that data engineers are less identical to plumbers and more to hydraulic and water resources engineers.\\nHydraulic and water resources engineers and data engineers resemble because\\n\\nBoth are engineers, a “mind role” and not a “manual role” like a plumber;\\nThey have a similar working scope of extracting/studying raw product, transforming it, storing it and deliver to the stakeholder;\\nThese positions always have to understand all the process end-to-end by being aware of downstream and upstream operations;\\nThe tools that both positions use are complex tools aiming calculation and analysis.\\n\\nAnd the cliché is down!\\nWhat do you think, do you agree with me?\\nDo you think I am going to be attacked by Mario Bros? 🧑\\u200d🔧\\nDid you like this article?

      "{'title': 'Starting a Career as a Data Scientist', 'body': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto by Razvan Chisu on Unsplash\\nData science has become one of the most in-demand fields in recent years. As companies increasingly collect and generate data, they need individuals who can sift through this information to identify trends and make predictions.\\nWhile a data scientist’s job may vary depending on the industry, their responsibilities usually fall into one of three categories: Type A, Type B, and Type C. In this article, we’ll explore the three main areas that data scientists should focus on. In addition, we’ll describe a possible strategy to start a career in Data Science and some tips to learn new skills.\\nThe article is organized as follows:\\n\\n\\nType A — the Analyst\\n\\n\\nType B — the Builder\\n\\n\\nType C — the Consultant\\n\\n\\nStarting a career in Data Science\\n\\n\\nLearning new skills\\n\\n\\nType A — the Analyst\\nType A stands for Analyst. As the name suggests, these individuals excel at analyzing data. They’re great at taking large amounts of data and making sense of it all.\\nAnalysts are often thought of as “traditional” data scientists. They are highly skilled in statistics and modeling, and they use these skills to extract insights from data. Analysts are often very good at communicating their findings to non-technical audiences since they understand both the technical details and the business implications of their work.\\nSkills\\nInitially, data analysts come from a very heavy research background. Over time the companies realized that these people were really rare. For this reason, currently, their actual study background doesn’t matter so much, it is more about their work experience. However, you can still have people with technical degrees, such as computer science degrees and statistics that would work as data analysts, although in most cases, these people fall in the Type B category.\\nA data analyst performs data analysis, being able to look at insights, do data visualization, make some dashboards, and try and figure out what’s going on with the data. That’s a very large component of data science.\\nAnother important skill for analysts is programming. Programming languages like R and Python are designed specifically for working with data. If you want to be able to manipulate data effectively, you need to know how to program.\\nThird, you need to have an open mind. Data science can be challenging, and it is important to be willing to learn new things. If you are closed-minded, you will likely find yourself struggling with data science.\\nLast but not least, a good data analyst should be curious. Once you have collected data, you should be curious about the data and start asking questions. Questions can lead to more questions, and this is how hypotheses are formed. For anyone who wants to improve their curiosity and keep learning more different things, you just have to make the decision that you want to learn more things. It’s as simple as that. Everyone can do their own version of curiosity.\\nType B — the Builder\\nType B stands for Builder. Builders are essentially software engineers, focused on the realm of data science applications. You do stuff in the cloud, set up the infrastructure, manage workflows, work with the data engineering team to make sure all the pipelines are solid, and force other members of your team to write clean code, unit tests, functional tests, and different things to make sure that the code will run in production.\\nYou can also think of them as the “new age machine learning engineers”. They build those systems and the Machine Learning ops, automated machine learning programs, and different things like that.\\nOne of the key differences between the Building type and the Analyst type is that the Building type always wants to work in the production environment. There’s almost a different mindset.\\nSkills\\nAs a Type B scientist, you should know frameworks like Git, Docker, and cloud computing platforms. These are important tools for managing and analyzing data.\\nGit is a version control system that lets you track changes to your code. Docker is a tool that helps you package up your code so it can run in different environments. Cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform provide scalable resources for storing and processing data.\\nDifferences between Type A and Type B\\nType A and Type B have a quite different mindset. Type A is more exploratory, and Type B focuses more on production.\\nThe type A data scientist will be very happy to play around in Jupyter Notebooks: take data from a CSV file, explore and see what’s there, and try to apply some machine learning to it straight away — after figuring out what the problem is, of course. But the Type B data scientist doesn’t want to do that. They think of all of that stuff as a waste of time. They’re going to refactor it, to change it somehow.\\nThe following figure shows the technical skills required for Types A and B:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nType C — the Consultant\\nType C stands for “Consultant”. In the past, a data scientist was the intersection of the programmer, mathematician, and business domain expert. This type C is essentially that person in the middle, but with very strong consulting skills.\\nAs the name suggests, consultants are all about giving advice. But unlike other types of data scientists, who tend to focus on either the technical aspects of data analysis or the business applications, consultants have really strong stakeholder engagement and communication to make sure that the business problems will be solved adequately with the right solutions.\\nConsultants are also experienced in working with a variety of different businesses, so they can quickly adapt to your company’s needs.\\nSkills\\nUsually, type C scientists are either people leaders or project managers. Or they’re very good at persuading and talking to business. If you’re a strong talker, you’re more likely to be a people leader. Usually, the type C data scientist will be your manager of data science, your head of data science, or your chief data scientist.\\nThere are different types of consultants as well. You can think of them as true consultants. They aren’t working very deep into the data. They’re talking about the process to solve problems, work closely with the stakeholders to figure out what the problems are and make sure that their concerns and issues are all addressed. But often we see that some leaders are not very technical.\\nThe most important thing for the Type C data scientist will be a commercial mindset: commercial acumen of being able to make decisions, people leadership, being able to talk to businesses, convince leaders to do something, as well as a storytelling piece.\\nStarting a career in Data Science\\nHere are a few things to keep in mind if you’re wondering if a career in data science is right for you:\\n\\n\\nData science is a team sport — No matter how talented you are, you won’t be able to do everything on your own. Data science is a collaborative field, so you’ll need to be able to work well with others. This means being able to communicate effectively and being open to different perspectives.\\n\\n\\nThe field is constantly changing — If you’re the type of person who likes stability and hates change, data science may not be the right fit for you. The field is constantly evolving, so you’ll need to be comfortable with change. This means being open to new ideas and technologies and\\n\\n\\nIn data science, it is often said that domain expertise is key. This is true to some extent — if you want to be a data scientist working on medical data, it helps to have a background in medicine. However, domain expertise is not always necessary to get started in data science.\\nWhere to start\\nAs a fresher, breaking into the data science field can seem daunting. However, with the right attitude and some hard work, it is definitely possible to make a name for yourself in this exciting and ever-growing industry. Here are a few tips on how to get started:\\n1. Learn Python or R. These are the two most popular programming languages for data science and are relatively easy to learn compared to other languages.\\n2. Get familiar with basic statistical concepts. Understanding means, median, mode, variance, etc. will be helpful in your journey to becoming a data scientist.\\n3. Start playing around with data! Use public datasets to practice your new skills or try out different data analysis techniques. Kaggle is a great resource for finding datasets and participating in competitions.\\n4. Learn Machine Learning. This is a huge field of study within data science and can seem daunting at first, but there are plenty of resources available to help you get started (including our own course!).\\n5. Networking is another key component of breaking into data science. Attend meetups and conferences, and connect with people already working in the field — they may be able to offer advice or even help you land your first job.\\n6. Stay up to date with the latest news and advancements in data science. Read blogs, listen to podcasts, watch talks online… there are lots of ways to stay informed about what’s going on in the world of data science.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLearning new skills\\nThere are many skills that are needed in order to work as a data scientist. However, there are also many skills that can be learned in order to become a data scientist. Many people who are interested in data science may not have the opportunity to learn these skills at their job. However, there are many ways to learn the skills outside of work.\\nOne way to learn the skills needed to become a data scientist is through online courses. There are many online courses that teach the basics of data science. These courses can be found on websites such as Coursera and Udacity. In addition, there are many blog posts and articles that can be found online that can help someone learn the basics of data science.\\nAnother way to learn the skills needed to become a data scientist is through conferences and meetups. There are many conferences and meetups that discuss data science topics. These events can be found in cities all over the world. Attendees of these events can learn from presentations and network with other people who are interested in data science.\\nFinally, another way to learn the skills needed to become a data scientist is through books. There are many books that have been written about data science.\\nSummary\\nCongratulations! You have just learned how to start a career in Data Science!\\nWhile a data scientist’s job may vary depending on the industry, their responsibilities usually fall into one of three categories: Type A, Type B, or Type C.\\nIn this article, we’ve explored the three main areas that data scientists should focus on. We’ve also described a possible strategy to start a career in Data Science and some tips to learn new skills.\\nIf you’re interested in pursuing a career in this exciting field, then be sure to keep these things in mind!\\nThe content of this article has been inspired by the podcast episode The ABC’s of Data Science with Danny Ma at DataTalks.Club.\\n', 'url': 'https://datatalks.club/blog/starting-career-as-data-scientist.html'}\n",

They work closely with business analysts, data analysts, data scientists, and project managers to build solutions that help businesses make sense of their data. If you want to understand deeper what the data engineer functions there are several articles and videos explaining it but I advise you to read this article with a video from Seattle Data Guy and this article from Coursera. But be aware of not mixing concepts by falling into the common cliché of saying that data engineers are similar to plumbers because both work with pipelines (see my article about this).\\nFor someone without an IT background (software engineering, computer science technical courses, or similar), getting a data engineer job may not be an easy task and straightforward. Even for someone with an engineering master’s degree or another technical background, it can be difficult to be accepted by companies that need data engineers.\\nIn this article, I am going to present the following:\\n\\nWhy is it so hard to get a data engineer job without an IT background?\\nFive guidelines to get a data engineer job\\n\\n1. Why is it so hard to get a data engineer job without an IT background?\\nThere is a shortage of data engineers but several companies need this professional leading to a mismatch between the number of data engineers needed and the available candidates. Even with the job market unbalanced, it is weird to think why a professional without an IT background can’t easily get a data engineer job.\\nWhy is this happening? For several reasons:\\n\\nA data engineer is not typically an entry-level position. Many employers look for data engineers with two or more years of experience in analytics, IT management, computer programming, or a role-related field. And getting into an IT job without a computer science background is difficult;\\n\\n\\n\\nMeme on “experience vs job” (extracted from me.me\\n\\n\\n\\nBecause data engineering is the intersection of software engineering and data science, some employers prefer candidates with at least a bachelor’s degree in a related field such as computer science or data science;\\n\\n\\nThere are not many specific specializations or pos-degrees in data engineering. Only now colleges and universities are attracting more interest in the study of data engineering by offering specializations and bachelor’s degrees in the field. Here are some exceptions online, Data Engineering Zoomcamp and Learn Data Engineering.\\n\\n\\nData engineer jobs are relatively new, and the industry is rapidly changing, with new technologies being developed all the time.

So even if a professional is very dedicated and willing to learn it will be set aside for someone with some knowledge in IT;\\n\\n\\nPrejudice and bias. 😐 It is weird to think about it but there is still some bias among IT professionals against non-IT background professionals. It is strange to happen this in 2022 but it still happens (It occurred to me more than once…);\\n\\n\\nI will explain in the next section how you can try to overcome all these problems and get a data engineer job against the odds.\\n2. Some guidelines to get a data engineer job\\n2.1. Education, education, education!!!\\n\\n\\nHard skills in IT it is important to get a data engineer job so you need to learn some basics (picture from Jeko in Unsplash)\\n\\nAs previously said, one barrier to obtaining a position as a data engineer for someone without IT experience is the lack of IT hard skills/knowledge. So the solution is “simple,” but laborious: you must complete a large number of courses, boot camps, or other sorts of education that any data engineer requires. A comprehensive and well-designed course/specialization or Bootcamp will provide you with the essential tools you need to become a data engineer. This is a great option if you don’t want to go to college (and honestly, it’s expensive).\\n“But which topics should I learn to work as a data engineer?” you may ask. There are numerous articles, websites, and publications that detail the courses of study required to become a data engineer. One great article is this Data Engineering Roadmap For 2021 from Ben Rogojan (AKA Seattle Data Guy) or if you want something more visual you also have this Modern Data Engineer Roadmap by data stack. tv.\\nIn my humble point of view, you should first learn:\\n\\nCoding: This is a very important skill in data engineering. My favorite programming language is Python but Scala and Java are also widely used in data engineering. Choose one and learn the basics, the more important modules, and something of programming object-oriented;\\nSQL and database fundamentals: SQL is the most important database language and it is essential in data engineering. First, you should learn the basics of DML and DDL, then understand how a relational database is organized, and in an advanced way you should learn data warehousing;\\nTools provided in clouds: To be a good data engineer, you should be able to work with tools available from cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform). Nowadays it is important to know how to work with cloud storage (eg. AWS S3, Google Storage), with databases on the cloud (eg. Redshift, BigQuery), with tools for data orchestration (eg. Azure Data factory) or with tools regarding Spark (eg. Databricks). I advise you to know, at least, which tools the main three cloud providers have to offer;\\nSome other software knowledge: You should also know some bash commands, how to work with version control, and some knowledge regarding the basics of IT.\\n\\nTo learn all these contents you can access the multiple free MOOC platforms available. If you don’t know which one to choose from see my favorites here.\\n2.2. Show yourself with data projects\\n\\n\\nA good portfolio is mandatory if you have 0 experience in IT (picture from Joshua Aragon in Unsplash)\\n\\nLike in the meme presented before you know it is harder to get a job without experience but you will get experience with a job. So, how do we break this negative cycle? By doing some personal projects and creating a portfolio.\\nData engineering job applicants are frequently asked about their projects. If you’ve never worked as a data engineer, you can explain a project you worked on for a course or submitted to GitHub after doing some IT challenges like HackerRank or LeetCode.\\nYou can also volunteer for some associations that do IT jobs pro-bono. For example, I did a web scraper for the Data Science For Social Good Portugal.\\n\\n\\nData Science for Social Good Portugal is a community of volunteers in data science and data engineering (official logo)\\n\\nAlso, a good idea is to “show yourself” with certificates and certifications. In this article, I explained which are the best.\\n2.3. Be the best friend with networking\\n\\n\\nNetworking is very important nowadays (picture from Chris Montgomery in Unsplash)\\n\\nWe have a popular saying in Portugal “Who has friends will not die in prison!” that says that if you have a strong network you will have great advances in life (unfortunately some people take that saying to the extreme😒 ).\\nHow to build and maintain a solid network?\\n\\n\\nFirst of all, you need to follow Linkedin the best professionals in data science and data engineering. If you don’t know who they are check my article here.;\\n\\nThen you should use several platforms to show yourself. For example, after an achievement writes on Twitter: “Hello everyone, today I finished my 100 HackerRank challenge”;\\nYou must connect to recruiters or professionals in companies you like. After the first connection it is important to keep in touch with them;\\nLast but not least, In platforms with professional purposes like Linkedin or Landing. jobs you must always (!!!!) keep your CV updated.\\n\\n2.4. Learn from failure\\n\\n\\nFailure is important to learn (picture from Brett Jordan on Unsplash)\\n\\nThis is a very important guideline because if you think like this you will always win, it is a win-win situation. Just remember that learning from failure means that sometimes you win and sometimes you learn something that will lead to winning in job seeking.\\nHow can this be applied in job searching?\\nWhen looking for a new job and you fail you have to take the time to reflect on the “WHY” you were not successful in a particular job search and to use that information to make changes and improvements in your approach. This might involve analyzing the feedback you received from employers, assessing your job search strategy, and identifying areas where you can improve your skills or qualifications.\\nIn my case, I used this principle, especially in the technical interviews. When, during the technical interview, I was asked one theme of data engineering that I didn’t know how to answer I went to study that theme for the next technical interview.\\n2.5 Be resilient, persistent, patient, and never give up\\nI finished my Master’s in Engineering in 2007, and only in 2017, I got my first good and stable engineering job. During those 10 years, I’ve been unemployed, in a foreign country, working in a non-technical area, etc… You can see the history of my professional experience in my article Every Time I am Cleaning the Dishes I Remember Norway …\\n\\n\\n\"A river cuts through a rock not because of its power but because of its persistence.\" by James N Watkins (picture from Àlex Rodriguez in Unsplash)\\n\\nIf you read my article you may be thinking I am an optimistic and positive person but… “Au Contraire My Friend”, I am a very pessimistic person and always with negative thoughts but I am not a quitter!! 😁I was able to achieve my current position because I was very persistent, I had to be patient and resilient.\\nResilience and persistence are important when looking for a new job because the process can be challenging and unpredictable. It will be common for you to face rejection or to have to apply to many jobs before finding the right fit. Being resilient can help you stay motivated and keep trying, even when faced with setbacks.\\nOverall, being resilient and persistent can be a valuable asset in the job search process and in your career.\\nSummary\\nGetting a data engineer job may not be an easy task and straightforward, especially for someone without an IT background.\\nIn this article, I presented to you the main reasons why getting a data engineer position is hard and how you can surpass some difficulties by following these five pieces of advice:\\n\\n\\nEducation, education, education!!!\\n\\n\\nShow yourself with data projects\\n\\n\\nBe the best friend with networking\\n\\n\\nLearn from failure\\n\\n\\nBe resilient, persistent, patient, and never give up\\n\\n\\nAnd you, are you trying to get a data engineer position?\\nAre you following these pieces of advice?\\nGood luck 😉\\nDid you like this article?

      "Heading: Roles in a Team\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A typical data team consists of the following roles:\n",
      "\n",
      "All these people work to create a data product.\n",
      "\n",
      "To explain the core responsibilities of each role, we will use a case scenario:\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose we work at an online classifieds company. It’s a platform where users can go to sell things they don’t need (like OLX, where I work). If a user has an iPhone they want to sell — they go to this website, create a listing and sell their phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this platform, sellers sometimes have problems with identifying the correct category for the items they are selling. To help them, we want to build a service that suggests the best category. To sell their iPhone, the user creates a listing and the site needs to automatically understand that this iPhone has to go in the “mobile phones” category.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with the first role: product manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Heading: Product Manager\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A product manager is someone responsible for developing products. Their goal is to make sure that the team is building the right thing. They are typically less technical than the rest of the team: they don’t focus on the implementation aspects of a problem, but rather the problem itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Product managers need to ensure that the product is actually used by the end-users. This is a common problem: in many companies, engineers create something that doesn’t solve real problems. Therefore, the product manager is somebody who speaks to the team on behalf of the users.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary skills a PM needs to have are communication skills. For data scientists, communication is a soft skill, but for a product manager — it’s a hard skill. They have to have it to perform their work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Product managers also do a lot of planning: they need to understand the problem, come up with a solution, and make sure the solution is implemented in a timely manner. To accomplish this, PMs need to know what’s important and plan the work accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "When somebody has a problem, they approach the PM with it. Then the task of the PM is to figure out if users actually need this feature, how important this feature is, and if the team has the capacity to implement it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s come back to our example. Suppose somebody comes to the PM and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“We want to build a feature to automatically suggest the category for a listing. Somebody’s selling an iPhone, and we want to create a service that predicts that the item goes in the mobile phones category.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Product managers need to answer these questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To answer these questions, PMs ask data analysts to help them figure out what to do next.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Heading: Data Analyst\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Data analysts know how to analyze the data available in the company. They discover insights in the data and then explain their findings to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, analysts need to know:\n",
      "\n",
      "Data analysts are also often responsible for defining key metrics and building different dashboards. This includes things like showing the company’s profits, displaying the number of listings, or how many contacts buyers made with sellers.  Thus, data analysts should know how to calculate all the important business metrics, and how to present them in a way that is understandable to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to skills, data analysts should know:\n",
      "\n",
      "For our example, product managers turn to data analysts to help them quantify the extent of the problem. Together with the PM, the data analyst tries to answer questions like:\n",
      "\n",
      "After the analyst gets the data, analyzes it and answers these questions, they may conclude: “Yes, this is actually a problem”. Then the PM and the team discuss the repost and agree: “Indeed, this problem is actually worth solving”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the data team will go ahead and start solving this problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the model for the service is created, it’s necessary to understand if the service is effective: whether this model helps people and solves the problem. For that, data analysts usually run experiments — usually, A/B tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "When running an experiment, we can see if more users successfully finish posting an item for sale or if there are fewer ads that end up in the wrong category.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Heading: Data Scientist\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The roles of a data scientist and data analyst are pretty similar. In some companies, it’s the same person who does both jobs. However, data scientists typically focus more on predicting rather than explaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "A data analyst fetches the data, looks at it, explains what’s going on to the team, and gives some recommendations on what to do about it. A data scientist, on the other hand, focuses more on creating machine learning services. For example, one of the questions that a data scientist would want to answer is “How can we use this data to build a machine learning model for predicting something?”\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, data scientists incorporate the data into the product. Their focus is more on engineering than analysis. Data scientists work more closely with engineers on integrating data solutions into the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "The skills of data scientists include:\n",
      "\n",
      "For our example, the data scientists are the people who develop the model used for predicting the category. Once they have a model, they can develop a simple web service for hosting this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Heading: Data Engineers\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Data engineers do all the heavy lifting when it comes to data. A lot of work needs to happen before data analysts can go to a database, fetch the data, perform their analysis, and come up with a report. This is precisely the focus of data engineers — they make sure this is possible. Their responsibility is to prepare all the necessary data in a form that is consumable for their colleagues.\n",
      "\n",
      "To accomplish this, data engineers create “a data lake”. All the data that users generate needs to be captured properly and saved in a separate database. This way, analysts can run their analysis, and data scientists can use this data for training models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing data engineers often need to do, especially at larger companies, is to ensure that the people who look at the data have the necessary clearance to do so. Some user data is sensitive and people can’t just go looking around at personal information (such as emails or phone numbers) unless they have a really good reason to do so. Therefore, data engineers need to set up a system that doesn’t let people just access all the data at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "The skills needed for data engineers usually include:\n",
      "\n",
      "In our example, a data engineer prepares all the required data. First, they make sure the analyst has the data to perform the analysis. Then they also work with the data scientist to prepare the information that we’ll need for training the model. That includes the title of the listing, its description, the category, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "A data engineer isn’t the only type of engineer that a data team has. There are also machine learning engineers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Heading: Machine Learning Engineer\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Machine learning engineers take whatever data scientists build and help them scale it up. They also ensure that the service is maintainable and that the team follows the best engineering practices. Their focus is more on engineering than on modeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The skills ML engineers have are similar to that of data engineers:\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, ML engineers work closely with more “traditional” engineers, like backend engineers, frontend engineers, or mobile engineers, to ensure that the services from the data team are included in the final product.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our example, ML engineers work together with data scientists on productionizing the category suggestion services. They make sure it’s stable once it’s rolled out to all the users. They must also ensure that it’s maintainable and it’s possible to make changes to the service in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s another kind of engineer that can be pretty important in a data team — site reliability engineers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Heading: DevOps / Site Reliability Engineer\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The role of SREs is similar to the ML engineer, but the focus is more on the availability and reliability of the services.\n",
      "\n",
      "SREs aren’t strictly limited to working with data. Their role is more general: they tend to focus less on business logic and more on infrastructure, which includes things like networking and provisioning infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, SREs look after the servers where the services are running and take care of collecting all the operational metrics like CPU usage, how many requests per second there are, the services’ processes, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the name suggests, site reliability engineers have to make sure that everything runs reliably. They set up alerts and are constantly on call to make sure that the services are up and running without any interruptions. If something breaks, SREs quickly diagnose the problem and fix it, or involve an engineer to help find the solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The skills needed for site reliability engineers:\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, ML engineers and data engineers should also know these best practices, but the focus of DevOps engineers/SREs is to establish them and make sure that they are followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a special type of DevOps engineer, called “MLOps engineer”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Heading: MLOps Engineer\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "An MLOps engineer is a DevOps engineer who also knows the basics of machine learning. Similar to an SRE, the responsibility of an MLOps Engineer is to make sure that the services, developed by data scientists, ML engineers, and data engineers, are up and running all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "MLOps engineers know the lifecycle of a machine learning model: the training phase, serving phase, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite having this knowledge, MLOps Engineers are still focused more on operational support than on anything else. This means that they need to know and follow all the DevOps practices and make sure that the rest of the team is following them as well. They accomplish this by setting up things like continuous retraining, and CI/CD pipelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though everyone in the team has a different focus, they all work together on achieving the same goal: solve the problems of the users.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Heading: Summary\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "To summarize, the roles in the data team and their responsibilities are:\n",
      "\n",
      "This list is not comprehensive, but it should be a good starting point if you are just getting into the industry, or if you just want to know how the lines between different roles are defined in the industry.\n",
      "\n",

       "  'body': '\\nIn this article, we’ll talk about different roles in a data team and discuss their responsibilities.\\nIn particular, we will cover:\\n\\nThe types of roles in a data team;\\nThe responsibilities of each role;\\nThe skills and knowledge each role needs to have.\\n\\n\\nWant to listen to it as a podcast? Go to Anchor.fm or your favorite podcasting platfrom.\\n\\nThis is not a comprehensive list and the majority of what you will read in this article is my opinion, which comes out of my experience from working as a data scientist.\\nYou can interpret the following information as “the description of data roles from the perspective of a data scientist”. For example, my views on the role of a data engineer may be a bit simplified because I don’t see all the complexities of their work firsthand. I do hope you will find this information useful nonetheless.\\nRoles in a Team\\nA typical data team consists of the following roles:\\n\\nProduct managers,\\nData analysts,\\nData scientists,\\nData engineers,\\nMachine learning engineers, and\\nSite reliability engineers / MLOps engineers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe data team.\\n\\n\\nAll these people work to create a data product.\\nTo explain the core responsibilities of each role, we will use a case scenario:\\nSuppose we work at an online classifieds company. It’s a platform where users can go to sell things they don’t need (like OLX, where I work). If a user has an iPhone they want to sell — they go to this website, create a listing and sell their phone.\\nOn this platform, sellers sometimes have problems with identifying the correct category for the items they are selling. To help them, we want to build a service that suggests the best category. To sell their iPhone, the user creates a listing and the site needs to automatically understand that this iPhone has to go in the “mobile phones” category.\\n\\n\\n\\nUse case: we want to build a service that automatically identifies the correct category for a listing.\\n\\n\\nLet’s start with the first role: product manager.\\nProduct Manager\\nA product manager is someone responsible for developing products. Their goal is to make sure that the team is building the right thing. They are typically less technical than the rest of the team: they don’t focus on the implementation aspects of a problem, but rather the problem itself.\\n\\n\\n\\nA product manager makes sure the team builds a product that users will use.\\n\\n\\nProduct managers need to ensure that the product is actually used by the end-users. This is a common problem: in many companies, engineers create something that doesn’t solve real problems. Therefore, the product manager is somebody who speaks to the team on behalf of the users.\\nThe primary skills a PM needs to have are communication skills. For data scientists, communication is a soft skill, but for a product manager — it’s a hard skill. They have to have it to perform their work.\\nProduct managers also do a lot of planning: they need to understand the problem, come up with a solution, and make sure the solution is implemented in a timely manner. To accomplish this, PMs need to know what’s important and plan the work accordingly.\\nWhen somebody has a problem, they approach the PM with it. Then the task of the PM is to figure out if users actually need this feature, how important this feature is, and if the team has the capacity to implement it.\\nLet’s come back to our example. Suppose somebody comes to the PM and says:\\n“We want to build a feature to automatically suggest the category for a listing. Somebody’s selling an iPhone, and we want to create a service that predicts that the item goes in the mobile phones category.”\\nProduct managers need to answer these questions:\\n\\n“Is this feature that important to the user?”\\n“Is it an important problem to solve in the product at all?”\\n\\nTo answer these questions, PMs ask data analysts to help them figure out what to do next.\\nData Analyst\\nData analysts know how to analyze the data available in the company. They discover insights in the data and then explain their findings to others.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnalysts discover insights in data.\\n\\n\\nSo, analysts need to know:\\n\\nWhat kind of data the company has;\\nHow to get the data;\\nHow to interpret the results;\\nHow to explain their findings to colleagues and management.\\n\\nData analysts are also often responsible for defining key metrics and building different dashboards. This includes things like showing the company’s profits, displaying the number of listings, or how many contacts buyers made with sellers.  Thus, data analysts should know how to calculate all the important business metrics, and how to present them in a way that is understandable to others.\\nWhen it comes to skills, data analysts should know:\\n\\nSQL — this is the main tool that they work with;\\nProgramming languages such as Python or R;\\nTableau or similar tools for building dashboards;\\nBasics of statistics;\\nHow to run experiments;\\nA bit of machine learning, such as regression analysis, and time series modeling.\\n\\nFor our example, product managers turn to data analysts to help them quantify the extent of the problem. Together with the PM, the data analyst tries to answer questions like:\\n\\n“How many users are affected by this problem?”\\n“How many users don’t finish creating their listing because of this problem?”\\n“How many listings are there on the platform that don’t have the right category selected?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe PM turns to the analyst to understand the extent of the problem.\\n\\n\\nAfter the analyst gets the data, analyzes it and answers these questions, they may conclude: “Yes, this is actually a problem”. Then the PM and the team discuss the repost and agree: “Indeed, this problem is actually worth solving”.\\nNow the data team will go ahead and start solving this problem.\\nAfter the model for the service is created, it’s necessary to understand if the service is effective: whether this model helps people and solves the problem. For that, data analysts usually run experiments — usually, A/B tests.\\nWhen running an experiment, we can see if more users successfully finish posting an item for sale or if there are fewer ads that end up in the wrong category.\\nData Scientist\\nThe roles of a data scientist and data analyst are pretty similar. In some companies, it’s the same person who does both jobs. However, data scientists typically focus more on predicting rather than explaining.\\nA data analyst fetches the data, looks at it, explains what’s going on to the team, and gives some recommendations on what to do about it. A data scientist, on the other hand, focuses more on creating machine learning services. For example, one of the questions that a data scientist would want to answer is “How can we use this data to build a machine learning model for predicting something?”\\n\\n\\n\\nData scientists create machine learning services.\\n\\n\\nIn other words, data scientists incorporate the data into the product. Their focus is more on engineering than analysis. Data scientists work more closely with engineers on integrating data solutions into the product.\\nThe skills of data scientists include:\\n\\nMachine learning — the main tool for building predictive services;\\nPython — the primary programming language;\\nSQL — necessary to fetch the data for training their models;\\nFlask, Docker, and similar — to create simple web services for serving the models.\\n\\nFor our example, the data scientists are the people who develop the model used for predicting the category. Once they have a model, they can develop a simple web service for hosting this model.\\nData Engineers\\nData engineers do all the heavy lifting when it comes to data. A lot of work needs to happen before data analysts can go to a database, fetch the data, perform their analysis, and come up with a report. This is precisely the focus of data engineers — they make sure this is possible. Their responsibility is to prepare all the necessary data in a form that is consumable for their colleagues.\\n\\n\\n\\nData engineers make the data available for data analysts and data scientists.\\n\\n\\nTo accomplish this, data engineers create “a data lake”. All the data that users generate needs to be captured properly and saved in a separate database. This way, analysts can run their analysis, and data scientists can use this data for training models.\\nAnother thing data engineers often need to do, especially at larger companies, is to ensure that the people who look at the data have the necessary clearance to do so. Some user data is sensitive and people can’t just go looking around at personal information (such as emails or phone numbers) unless they have a really good reason to do so. Therefore, data engineers need to set up a system that doesn’t let people just access all the data at once.\\nThe skills needed for data engineers usually include:\\n\\nAWS or Google Cloud — popular cloud providers;\\nKubernetes and Terraform — infrastructure tools;\\nKafka or RabbitMQ — tools for capturing and processing the data;\\nDatabases — to save the data in such a way that it’s accessible for data analysts;\\nAirflow or Luigi — data orchestration tools for building complex data pipelines.\\n\\nIn our example, a data engineer prepares all the required data. First, they make sure the analyst has the data to perform the analysis. Then they also work with the data scientist to prepare the information that we’ll need for training the model. That includes the title of the listing, its description, the category, and so on.\\nA data engineer isn’t the only type of engineer that a data team has. There are also machine learning engineers.\\nMachine Learning Engineer\\nMachine learning engineers take whatever data scientists build and help them scale it up. They also ensure that the service is maintainable and that the team follows the best engineering practices. Their focus is more on engineering than on modeling.\\n\\n\\n\\nMachine learning engineers help data scientists put the model into production.\\n\\n\\nThe skills ML engineers have are similar to that of data engineers:\\n\\nAWS or Google Cloud;\\nInfrastructure tools like Kubernetes and Terraform;\\nPython and other programming languages;\\nFlask, Docker, and other tools for creating web services.\\n\\nAdditionally, ML engineers work closely with more “traditional” engineers, like backend engineers, frontend engineers, or mobile engineers, to ensure that the services from the data team are included in the final product.\\nFor our example, ML engineers work together with data scientists on productionizing the category suggestion services. They make sure it’s stable once it’s rolled out to all the users. They must also ensure that it’s maintainable and it’s possible to make changes to the service in the future.\\nThere’s another kind of engineer that can be pretty important in a data team — site reliability engineers.\\nDevOps / Site Reliability Engineer\\nThe role of SREs is similar to the ML engineer, but the focus is more on the availability and reliability of the services.\\nSREs aren’t strictly limited to working with data. Their role is more general: they tend to focus less on business logic and more on infrastructure, which includes things like networking and provisioning infrastructure.\\n\\n\\n\\nSREs take care of the infrastructure and make sure the services work reliably.\\n\\n\\nTherefore, SREs look after the servers where the services are running and take care of collecting all the operational metrics like CPU usage, how many requests per second there are, the services’ processes, and so on.\\nAs the name suggests, site reliability engineers have to make sure that everything runs reliably. They set up alerts and are constantly on call to make sure that the services are up and running without any interruptions. If something breaks, SREs quickly diagnose the problem and fix it, or involve an engineer to help find the solution.\\nThe skills needed for site reliability engineers:\\n\\nCloud infrastructure tools;\\nProgramming languages like Python,\\nUnix/Linux;\\nNetworking;\\nBest DevOps practices like automation, CI/CD, and the like.\\n\\nOf course, ML engineers and data engineers should also know these best practices, but the focus of DevOps engineers/SREs is to establish them and make sure that they are followed.\\nThere is a special type of DevOps engineer, called “MLOps engineer”.\\nMLOps Engineer\\nAn MLOps engineer is a DevOps engineer who also knows the basics of machine learning. Similar to an SRE, the responsibility of an MLOps Engineer is to make sure that the services, developed by data scientists, ML engineers, and data engineers, are up and running all the time.\\nMLOps engineers know the lifecycle of a machine learning model: the training phase, serving phase, and so on.\\nDespite having this knowledge, MLOps Engineers are still focused more on operational support than on anything else. This means that they need to know and follow all the DevOps practices and make sure that the rest of the team is following them as well. They accomplish this by setting up things like continuous retraining, and CI/CD pipelines.\\nEven though everyone in the team has a different focus, they all work together on achieving the same goal: solve the problems of the users.\\nSummary\\nTo summarize, the roles in the data team and their responsibilities are:\\n\\nProduct managers — make sure that the team is building the right thing, act as a gateway to all the requests and speak on behalf of the users.\\nData analysts — analyze data, define key metrics, and create dashboards.\\nData scientists — build models and incorporate them into the product.\\nData engineers — prepare the data for analysts and data scientists.\\nML engineers — productionize machine learning services and establish the best engineering practices.\\nSite reliability engineers — focus on availability, reliability, enforce the best DevOps practices.\\n\\nThis list is not comprehensive, but it should be a good starting point if you are just getting into the industry, or if you just want to know how the lines between different roles are defined in the industry.\\n\\nThis article is based on the podcast “Roles in a data team”.

In this article, we’ll explore some tips on how to build an effective data science team.\\nThe article is organized as follows:\\n\\nhow to start building a data science team\\nspecialists vs generalists\\nwho to hire first\\nwhat is a strong product team\\nmotivating team to write articles and contribute to open source\\npicking the next projects to work on.\\n\\nHow to start building a data science team\\nThere are two ways to start building a data team, as shown in the following figure:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDefining a project and then starting recruiting — In this case, you should start with the following questions: What problems are you trying to solve? What kind of data do you need to build your project? Answering these questions will help you determine the skillsets and expertise you need on your team. Once you have an idea of the team you need, it’s time to start recruiting.\\n\\n\\nStarting immediately hiring and then defining a project — In this case, you start the recruiting campaign, and then define the project.\\n\\n\\nIndeed, there is no solution better than the other. In fact, some companies firstly define the project and then start hiring, and other companies that do exactly the opposite. A good trade-off could be a combination of both, in the sense that you could start from a vision, which defines what the end goal should be, but the final product is still unclear.\\nAlthough you could have in your mind your final goal, you may not know which features will lead to the final product. For this reason, you could start hiring different roles that would take you to that point to get a better understanding of your vision.\\nThe best way to find talented data scientists is through referrals from people you trust. Attend meetups and conferences related to data science and big data, and post job listings on relevant online communities and forums.\\nOnce you have a few candidates, it’s important to evaluate their skillset carefully. In addition to technical ability, you want to make sure they have strong communication skills and are able to work well in a team environment. The best way to assess these skills is through coding challenges and interviews that test both their technical abilities and soft skills.\\nBuilding a data team can be a challenge, but it’s definitely doable with careful planning and execution. By keeping these tips in mind, you’ll be well on your way\\nSpecialists vs generalists\\nWhen you start hiring, you may search for two types of profiles, as shown in the following figure:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngeneralists — professionals who have a general knowledge of all the Data Science workflow, from project setup to project deployment, but they do not have specific knowledge of the single steps of the Data Science workflow.\\n\\n\\nspecialists — professionals who have specific knowledge of a single step of the Data Science workflow, but do not know the general Data Science workflow.\\n\\n\\nIf you decide to hire specialists, you’ll need to make sure that each team member is able to work together and share their knowledge. This can be a challenge, but if you have the right mix of people it can lead to a very strong team. The advantage of this approach is that each team member will be an expert in their own area and they’ll be able to bring a lot of knowledge to the table.\\nIf you decide to go with a team of generalists, the advantage of this approach is that everyone will have a good understanding of the whole data science process.\\nIn a startup, you should hire first generalists — people who can do pretty much everything. In fact, when you start, you have no lines of code. There’s nothing, which means you need to do back end, front end, DevOps, and whatever.\\nInstead, if your company is already stable, probably you need more specialists, who focus on specific problems, such as tuning hyperparameters of a Machine Learning model.\\nAs your company grows, you may begin hiring more and more specialists and fewer generalists.\\nWho to hire first\\nWhen building a data science team, it can be difficult to decide who to hire first. The answer, of course, depends on your specific needs.\\nBut in general, we recommend hiring first the following three profiles, as shown in the following figure:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMachine Learning engineers or Software engineers with Machine Learning skills.\\n\\n\\nData engineers, that build and maintain the systems that collect and store all that data.\\n\\n\\nProduct managers, that prioritize the work to do.\\n\\n\\nAt the beginning, you need people who can work on the prototype, who will write a lot of coding, and who will work on the product. It doesn’t make sense for you to hire a UX/UI designer when you have no work for them.\\nOf course, every team is different, and you may find that you need to hire a different combination of roles depending on your unique circumstances. So you really need to understand, at which stage you are. And what kind of roles do you need now to solve this problem.\\nWhat is a strong product team\\nTo build a strong product team, it is important to first understand what a product team is. A product team is responsible for the development and management of a company’s products. This includes everything from the initial idea and conception of the product, to its design, production, and eventual distribution.\\nA strong product team is a team that is building a product that the customer wants. Strong means:\\n\\n\\nvery customer-centric\\n\\n\\ndelivering features very fast\\n\\n\\ntesting these things out with customers very fast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn other words, a strong product team will have a clear understanding of the market they are targeting and will work together to ensure that the final product meets the needs of their target audience. In order to build a strong product team, it is important to have a clear vision for the product and to assemble a team of individuals with the skills and experience necessary to bring that vision to fruition.\\nMotivating team to write articles and contribute to open source\\nData science is a collaborative field, and one of the best ways to learn and improve your skills is to share your knowledge with others. Writing blog posts and articles is a great way to do this, and it can also be a good motivator for your team.\\nYou should encourage your team members to write articles about their work and provide them with any resources they need to get started. You can also offer incentives for writing articles, such as bonus points or rewards.\\nContributing to open-source projects is another great way for your team to learn and improve their skills. You could even encourage your team members to find projects they’re interested in and contribute their time and expertise. Again, you can offer incentives for open source contributions, such as bonus points or rewards.\\nHiring a data scientist\\nWhen it comes to building a data science team, one of the most important things to consider is hiring a data scientist. While there are many different ways to go about this, there are a few key things to keep in mind.\\nFirst, it’s important to find someone with the right skillset. You can look at the candidate curriculum. A data scientist should be able to not only analyze data, but also understand how to use that data to solve real-world problems. Additionally, they should be well-versed in statistics and modeling, and be able to communicate their findings effectively.\\nOnce you’ve found a few candidates with the right skillset, it’s important to interview them thoroughly. In addition to questions about their experience and qualifications, be sure to ask them about their approach to data science and how they would go about solving a specific problem. This will help you get a better sense of their thought process and whether or not they would be a good fit for your team.\\nThe interview should also include questions on personal experiences, to check whether that person is interesting or not. If someone is just plain boring, this is very difficult for the team. That person also needs a hobby, such as going to the cinema, doing some sports, or whatever. But that person needs to do something. You work more time with that person than you spend with your girlfriend or your wife. You spend more time with them than with the person that you love. So that’s why you need to understand that person really well.\\nYou could also include a second interview, which could be a homework assignment. You could send out some homework, which is not very difficult. Then the candidate sends you the code, whether it is Jupyter Notebook or whatever. Then you should check it. From this simple task, you could already see how much people are working.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPicking the next projects to work on\\nThere are a lot of data science projects out there, and it can be tough to decide which ones to tackle next. Here are a few things to keep in mind when choosing projects:\\n\\n\\nConsider the impact of the project. Will it make a big difference for your company or customers?\\n\\n\\nThink about the difficulty of the project. Is it something you and your team are confident you can handle?\\n\\n\\nTake into account the resources you have available. Do you have the time and budget to dedicate to this project?\\n\\n\\nLastly, don’t forget to have some fun! Data science is supposed to be enjoyable, so pick projects that seem interesting and exciting to you and your team.\\n\\n\\nSummary\\nCongratulations! You have just learned some tips on how to build a data science team!\\nData science is a rapidly growing field, and it can be difficult to build an effective data science team. However, by following the advice in this article, you can create a team that is well-equipped to tackle your data science projects.\\nWhen building a data science team, it is important to consider the skills and experience of each team member. The team should have a mix of technical and non-technical skills, as well as a variety of domain expertise. In addition, the team should be able to work together collaboratively to solve complex problems.\\nOnce you have assembled your team, you need to provide them with the resources they need to be successful. This includes access to data, computing power, and software tools. In addition, you need to create an environment that encourages creativity and collaboration.\\nBy following these tips, you can build a data science team that is poised for success!\\nHappy Data Science!\\nThe content of this article has been inspired by the podcast episode Building a Data Science Team with Dat Tran at DataTalks.Club.\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto by krakenimages on Unsplash\\nThere’s a lot of debate in the tech world about whether data science managers or data science experts are more valuable to organizations. Some believe that managers are better able to develop and implement strategy, while others argue that experts are more skilled at working with data.\\nSo, which is it? In this article, we’ll explore the pros and cons of each option to help you make a decision for your organization.\\nThe article is organized as follows:\\n\\n\\nThe roles of manager and expert\\n\\n\\nDo you need a manager or an expert?\\n\\n\\nSkills\\n\\n\\nResponsibilities\\n\\n\\nWorking in a team\\n\\n\\nDo you need a manager or an expert?\\n\\n\\nThe roles of manager and expert\\nThe expert role is different from the manager’s because experts need a very deep understanding of algorithms and technologies from the area in which they have many years of experience, while managers only have a general knowledge of the topic. Very often, an expert doesn’t only have a good knowledge of technology, but also domain knowledge.\\nData science managers are responsible for a team of data scientists and ensuring that projects are completed on time and within budget. They also work with clients to understand their needs and ensure that the team is meeting their expectations.\\nData science experts are responsible for providing insights and recommendations based on data analysis. They also develop and test models to improve decision-making and help businesses solve complex problems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkills\\nThere are a number of requirements that data science managers need to be aware of, both technical and non-technical. On the technical side, they need to have a good understanding of the various data science tools and techniques available, as well as how to use them effectively. They also need to be able to understand and interpret the results of data science experiments and provide feedback to the team.\\nNon-technical requirements for data science managers include good communication and interpersonal skills, as well as project management experience. They need to be able to work with different teams within an organization and be able to manage multiple projects simultaneously.\\nAs a data science manager, it is important to also have technical skills. It is important to understand how it works but on a high level. This allows you to better understand the work your team is doing and to provide more effective guidance. Additionally, technical skills can help you build credibility with your team and improve your ability to troubleshoot issues.\\nData science experts are often highly technical individuals with deep knowledge in a particular area. While this expertise can be invaluable, it is not always necessary for data science managers. In many cases, general management skills and an understanding of data science principles are sufficient.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResponsibilities\\nThe responsibilities of a data science manager involve:\\n\\n\\nleading and coordinating a team of data scientists\\n\\n\\ndeveloping data science strategies\\n\\n\\noverseeing projects from start to finish\\n\\n\\ndirecting the personal development of each team member.\\n\\n\\nManagers have a holistic approach to data science projects. They don’t only know and use technologies and models, but they also communicate with stakeholders and business users. They understand all the requirements of the machine learning models very well and how they will be used by business users. With this holistic approach, they should be able to identify new opportunities to leverage data science in various business areas.\\nAs a data science manager, you will be responsible for developing and managing a team of data scientists. In addition to overseeing the work of your team, you will also be involved in business development and sales. This means that you will need to have strong communication and presentation skills. You will also need to be able to negotiate deals with clients and partners.\\nData science experts, on the other hand, are responsible for executing data science projects. They possess in-depth knowledge of algorithms and statistical techniques and are able to wrangle large data sets. They also have strong communication skills, which are essential for collaborating with other members of the data science team.\\nAs a data science expert, you will be responsible for conducting research and developing new techniques and methods for data analysis. You will also be involved in the implementation of these techniques into projects. In addition to your technical expertise, you will also need to have strong communication and presentation skills.\\nWorking in a team\\nAs a data science manager, one of your primary responsibilities is to develop and manage a team of data scientists. This includes hiring talented individuals, providing them with the resources they need to do their job effectively, and setting clear expectations. Additionally, you need to ensure that your team is working together harmoniously and effectively towards common goals.\\nAs a data science manager, it’s important to be able to check your team’s work and make sure that they are on the right track. This means being able to understand the data and the analysis that they are doing. If you aren’t able to do this, then it will be difficult to manage the team and make sure that they are productive. A data science manager should also tell each member which direction he or she should take and tell them what the goals for the year or for the month are.\\nData science experts are often able to provide insights and suggestions that can help improve the work of the data science team. In addition, data science experts are often able to build strong teams because of their deep understanding of the field. They know what skills and knowledge are necessary for success and can identify talented individuals. Data science managers, on the other hand, may not have the same level of expertise. While they may be able to identify potential team members, they may not have the ability to fully assess their skills and knowledge.\\nDo you need a manager or an expert?\\nThe answer to this question may depend on the size and scope of your project.\\nIf you have a large project with many moving parts, then you might need a data science manager to keep everything organized and on track. A manager can also be helpful in coordinating team members with different skill sets.\\nOn the other hand, if your project is more focused and you have a clear idea of what you want to achieve, then you might be better off working with a data science expert. An expert can help you fine-tune your project and ensure success.\\nUltimately, the decision of whether to work with a manager or an expert depends on your specific needs and goals. If you are unsure, it might be helpful to consult with both types of professionals to get a sense of what would work best for your project.\\nAnyway, you should keep in mind that if you hire first a data science manager, then the manager would basically build a data science team.\\nSummary\\nCongratulations! You have just learned the difference between data science manager and data science expert!\\nData science managers are responsible for leading teams of data scientists and ensuring that projects are completed on time and within budget. They also need to have general technical skills and be able to effectively communicate results to non-technical stakeholders. Data science experts, on the other hand, are responsible for actually doing the work of data analysis and modeling. They need to have a deep understanding of statistics and machine learning and be able to effectively communicate their findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.\\nSo, which role is right for you? If you feel like you have the leadership skills necessary to manage a team of data scientists, then a data science manager might be the right choice. If you’d rather focus on the actual work of data science, then a data science expert might be a better fit.\\nUltimately, it’s up to you to decide which role best suits your job!\\nThe content of this article has been inspired by the podcast episode Data Science Manager vs Data Science Expert with Barbara Sobkowiak at DataTalks.Club.\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '\\n\\n\\nWater pipes (Photo by LoggaWiggler on Pixabay)\\n\\nEvery time we open an article with a title similar to “What is a data engineer?” or “The difference between data engineer and data scientist” we get a cliche answer: Data engineers are like plumbers.\\nNo! No! No! That is wrong. A data engineer can work with pipelines like a plumber but the role is very different.\\nIn this article, I will show you that a data engineer is similar to another profession/job: hydraulic and water resources engineer.\\nI will explain why in three simple arguments:\\n\\nWorking titles;\\nTask goals;\\nTools needed to develop work.\\n\\n1. The titles are the same\\nWell, this is obvious, right? 🙂 They are both engineers.\\n\\n\\nMathematics (Photo by ArtsyBee on Pixabay)\\n\\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, an engineer is “someone who designs, builds or maintains engines, machines, or structures”.\\nEach role may focus on different resources/products/processes, “water” for hydraulic and water resources engineers, and “data” for data engineers but both handle engineering on it.\\nThey are more “thinking” roles than “manual” roles (like a plumber) since they have to reflect and calculate what are the best solutions for their processes and not act by simple guidelines.\\n2. Both have similar working goals\\nThis section is similar to the previous but we are focusing on the goal of each engineer.\\nFor example, a mechanical engineer has the working scope to build, maintain and improve mechanical machines that will perform some tasks.\\nI’m considering a data engineer has the objective of building, maintaining, and improving data pipelines (ETL or ELT processes), data storage structures (data warehouses or data lakes), and providing solid data to the stakeholders.\\nIn a detailed way, the professional has the working scope of guarantee the a) extraction of data from various sources (both internal like relational databases and external sources), b) transformation of data using solid programming skills or software, c) good organization of the data in the correct storage structures and d) quality/organization of all the end-to-end processes and data using orchestrator tools, monitoring tools or other control tools.\\nA data engineer needs to think of the process as a whole considering downstream and upstream mechanisms.\\n\\n\\nWater Treatment plant (Photo by Marcin Jozwiak on Pexels)\\n\\nThe specialization of Hydraulic and Water Resources Engineering by the McGill University of Canada describes these two disciplines as follows:\\n“Water resources engineering is the quantitative study of the hydrologic cycle — the distribution and circulation of water linking the earth’s atmosphere, land and oceans. (…) Applications include the management of the urban water supply, the design of urban storm-sewer systems, and flood forecasting.” and “Hydraulic engineering consists of the application of fluid mechanics to water flowing in an isolated environment (pipe, pump) or in an open channel (river, lake, ocean). Applications include the design of hydraulic structures, such as sewage conduits, dams and breakwaters, the management of waterways, such as erosion protection and flood protection, and environmental management, such as prediction of the mixing and transport of pollutants in surface water.”.\\nTherefore I’m considering hydraulic and water resources engineers need to guarantee (besides other tasks)\\na) the extraction of water from various sources,\\nb) the correct water cleaning in water treatment facilities (see image above),\\nc) good organization of the water in the correct storage structures, and\\nd) quality/organization of all the end-to-end processes with several control tools.\\nIn the table below it is possible to see how identical both roles are in terms of working processes, tasks, or goals (with some examples).\\n\\n\\n\\nProcesses/Task/Scope\\nData Engineer\\nHydraulic and Water Resources Engineer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExtraction of raw product from sources\\nRelational databases, External API, or CRM data.\\nSurface water, groundwater, or wastewater.\\n\\n\\nDevelopment and maintain transformation processes\\nData transformation by cleaning, deduplication, or data type correction.\\nWater cleaning by removing organic compounds, or non-organic compounds.\\n\\n\\nDevelopment and maintain storage structure\\nData warehouse, data Lakes.\\nWater towers, water dams.\\n\\n\\nDevelopment of the full process construction\\nData orchestration tools.\\nComputer tools to draw all systems, and wastewater treatment plants.\\n\\n\\nControlling/Monitoring processes and product\\nSoftware tools for data lineage or process control\\nSensors all over the process\\n\\n\\nStakeholders\\nData analysts, Data Scientists.\\nCities, industrial.\\n\\n\\n\\nTherefore you can see that even having different targets both engineers do similar tasks.\\n3. They use identical tools\\nIn that cliché of “data engineer equals plumber” it is often written that both have tools. However, the plumber tools are different from the data engineer tools. But both data engineers and hydraulic and water resources engineers use similar tools.\\nConsidering the processes present in the table above I will present you some examples for each role.\\nFor data engineers:\\n\\nSQL for analysis of the data sources;\\nPython, Scala or other programming languages for development.\\nAirflow, Luigi or other for the development of the full process construction\\nGrafana and data testing tools to control and monitor.\\n\\nFor hydraulic and water resources engineer:\\n\\nTools for geo analysis or GIS tools for analysis of the sources area;\\nExcel or similar tool for calculus;\\nCAD software tools for the development of the full process construction;\\nSensors for quality and quantity water control.\\n\\nSo all the tools for both engineers are complex tools (mostly software) with the purpose of proceeding to the estimation of the best solution. They are not manual tools like hammers.\\nConclusion\\nIn summary it was presented in three simple subjects that data engineers are less identical to plumbers and more to hydraulic and water resources engineers.\\nHydraulic and water resources engineers and data engineers resemble because\\n\\nBoth are engineers, a “mind role” and not a “manual role” like a plumber;\\nThey have a similar working scope of extracting/studying raw product, transforming it, storing it and deliver to the stakeholder;\\nThese positions always have to understand all the process end-to-end by being aware of downstream and upstream operations;\\nThe tools that both positions use are complex tools aiming calculation and analysis.\\n\\nAnd the cliché is down!\\nWhat do you think, do you agree with me?\\nDo you think I am going to be attacked by Mario Bros? 🧑\\u200d🔧\\nDid you like this article?

       "  'body': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto by Razvan Chisu on Unsplash\\nData science has become one of the most in-demand fields in recent years. As companies increasingly collect and generate data, they need individuals who can sift through this information to identify trends and make predictions.\\nWhile a data scientist’s job may vary depending on the industry, their responsibilities usually fall into one of three categories: Type A, Type B, and Type C. In this article, we’ll explore the three main areas that data scientists should focus on. In addition, we’ll describe a possible strategy to start a career in Data Science and some tips to learn new skills.\\nThe article is organized as follows:\\n\\n\\nType A — the Analyst\\n\\n\\nType B — the Builder\\n\\n\\nType C — the Consultant\\n\\n\\nStarting a career in Data Science\\n\\n\\nLearning new skills\\n\\n\\nType A — the Analyst\\nType A stands for Analyst. As the name suggests, these individuals excel at analyzing data. They’re great at taking large amounts of data and making sense of it all.\\nAnalysts are often thought of as “traditional” data scientists. They are highly skilled in statistics and modeling, and they use these skills to extract insights from data. Analysts are often very good at communicating their findings to non-technical audiences since they understand both the technical details and the business implications of their work.\\nSkills\\nInitially, data analysts come from a very heavy research background. Over time the companies realized that these people were really rare. For this reason, currently, their actual study background doesn’t matter so much, it is more about their work experience. However, you can still have people with technical degrees, such as computer science degrees and statistics that would work as data analysts, although in most cases, these people fall in the Type B category.\\nA data analyst performs data analysis, being able to look at insights, do data visualization, make some dashboards, and try and figure out what’s going on with the data. That’s a very large component of data science.\\nAnother important skill for analysts is programming. Programming languages like R and Python are designed specifically for working with data. If you want to be able to manipulate data effectively, you need to know how to program.\\nThird, you need to have an open mind. Data science can be challenging, and it is important to be willing to learn new things. If you are closed-minded, you will likely find yourself struggling with data science.\\nLast but not least, a good data analyst should be curious. Once you have collected data, you should be curious about the data and start asking questions. Questions can lead to more questions, and this is how hypotheses are formed. For anyone who wants to improve their curiosity and keep learning more different things, you just have to make the decision that you want to learn more things. It’s as simple as that. Everyone can do their own version of curiosity.\\nType B — the Builder\\nType B stands for Builder. Builders are essentially software engineers, focused on the realm of data science applications. You do stuff in the cloud, set up the infrastructure, manage workflows, work with the data engineering team to make sure all the pipelines are solid, and force other members of your team to write clean code, unit tests, functional tests, and different things to make sure that the code will run in production.\\nYou can also think of them as the “new age machine learning engineers”. They build those systems and the Machine Learning ops, automated machine learning programs, and different things like that.\\nOne of the key differences between the Building type and the Analyst type is that the Building type always wants to work in the production environment. There’s almost a different mindset.\\nSkills\\nAs a Type B scientist, you should know frameworks like Git, Docker, and cloud computing platforms. These are important tools for managing and analyzing data.\\nGit is a version control system that lets you track changes to your code. Docker is a tool that helps you package up your code so it can run in different environments. Cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform provide scalable resources for storing and processing data.\\nDifferences between Type A and Type B\\nType A and Type B have a quite different mindset. Type A is more exploratory, and Type B focuses more on production.\\nThe type A data scientist will be very happy to play around in Jupyter Notebooks: take data from a CSV file, explore and see what’s there, and try to apply some machine learning to it straight away — after figuring out what the problem is, of course. But the Type B data scientist doesn’t want to do that. They think of all of that stuff as a waste of time. They’re going to refactor it, to change it somehow.\\nThe following figure shows the technical skills required for Types A and B:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nType C — the Consultant\\nType C stands for “Consultant”. In the past, a data scientist was the intersection of the programmer, mathematician, and business domain expert. This type C is essentially that person in the middle, but with very strong consulting skills.\\nAs the name suggests, consultants are all about giving advice. But unlike other types of data scientists, who tend to focus on either the technical aspects of data analysis or the business applications, consultants have really strong stakeholder engagement and communication to make sure that the business problems will be solved adequately with the right solutions.\\nConsultants are also experienced in working with a variety of different businesses, so they can quickly adapt to your company’s needs.\\nSkills\\nUsually, type C scientists are either people leaders or project managers. Or they’re very good at persuading and talking to business. If you’re a strong talker, you’re more likely to be a people leader. Usually, the type C data scientist will be your manager of data science, your head of data science, or your chief data scientist.\\nThere are different types of consultants as well. You can think of them as true consultants. They aren’t working very deep into the data. They’re talking about the process to solve problems, work closely with the stakeholders to figure out what the problems are and make sure that their concerns and issues are all addressed. But often we see that some leaders are not very technical.\\nThe most important thing for the Type C data scientist will be a commercial mindset: commercial acumen of being able to make decisions, people leadership, being able to talk to businesses, convince leaders to do something, as well as a storytelling piece.\\nStarting a career in Data Science\\nHere are a few things to keep in mind if you’re wondering if a career in data science is right for you:\\n\\n\\nData science is a team sport — No matter how talented you are, you won’t be able to do everything on your own. Data science is a collaborative field, so you’ll need to be able to work well with others. This means being able to communicate effectively and being open to different perspectives.\\n\\n\\nThe field is constantly changing — If you’re the type of person who likes stability and hates change, data science may not be the right fit for you. The field is constantly evolving, so you’ll need to be comfortable with change. This means being open to new ideas and technologies and\\n\\n\\nIn data science, it is often said that domain expertise is key. This is true to some extent — if you want to be a data scientist working on medical data, it helps to have a background in medicine. However, domain expertise is not always necessary to get started in data science.\\nWhere to start\\nAs a fresher, breaking into the data science field can seem daunting. However, with the right attitude and some hard work, it is definitely possible to make a name for yourself in this exciting and ever-growing industry. Here are a few tips on how to get started:\\n1. Learn Python or R. These are the two most popular programming languages for data science and are relatively easy to learn compared to other languages.\\n2. Get familiar with basic statistical concepts. Understanding means, median, mode, variance, etc. will be helpful in your journey to becoming a data scientist.\\n3. Start playing around with data! Use public datasets to practice your new skills or try out different data analysis techniques. Kaggle is a great resource for finding datasets and participating in competitions.\\n4. Learn Machine Learning. This is a huge field of study within data science and can seem daunting at first, but there are plenty of resources available to help you get started (including our own course!).\\n5. Networking is another key component of breaking into data science. Attend meetups and conferences, and connect with people already working in the field — they may be able to offer advice or even help you land your first job.\\n6. Stay up to date with the latest news and advancements in data science. Read blogs, listen to podcasts, watch talks online… there are lots of ways to stay informed about what’s going on in the world of data science.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLearning new skills\\nThere are many skills that are needed in order to work as a data scientist. However, there are also many skills that can be learned in order to become a data scientist. Many people who are interested in data science may not have the opportunity to learn these skills at their job. However, there are many ways to learn the skills outside of work.\\nOne way to learn the skills needed to become a data scientist is through online courses. There are many online courses that teach the basics of data science. These courses can be found on websites such as Coursera and Udacity. In addition, there are many blog posts and articles that can be found online that can help someone learn the basics of data science.\\nAnother way to learn the skills needed to become a data scientist is through conferences and meetups. There are many conferences and meetups that discuss data science topics. These events can be found in cities all over the world.

       "  'body': '\\n\\n\\nGetting a data engineer job is not accessible if you don’t have an IT background (Image from Geralt in Pixabay)\\n\\nData engineers are responsible for managing big data sets and building applications to move, transform and analyze them. They work closely with business analysts, data analysts, data scientists, and project managers to build solutions that help businesses make sense of their data. If you want to understand deeper what the data engineer functions there are several articles and videos explaining it but I advise you to read this article with a video from Seattle Data Guy and this article from Coursera. But be aware of not mixing concepts by falling into the common cliché of saying that data engineers are similar to plumbers because both work with pipelines (see my article about this).\\nFor someone without an IT background (software engineering, computer science technical courses, or similar), getting a data engineer job may not be an easy task and straightforward. Even for someone with an engineering master’s degree or another technical background, it can be difficult to be accepted by companies that need data engineers.\\nIn this article, I am going to present the following:\\n\\nWhy is it so hard to get a data engineer job without an IT background?\\nFive guidelines to get a data engineer job\\n\\n1. Why is it so hard to get a data engineer job without an IT background?\\nThere is a shortage of data engineers but several companies need this professional leading to a mismatch between the number of data engineers needed and the available candidates. Even with the job market unbalanced, it is weird to think why a professional without an IT background can’t easily get a data engineer job.\\nWhy is this happening? For several reasons:\\n\\nA data engineer is not typically an entry-level position. Many employers look for data engineers with two or more years of experience in analytics, IT management, computer programming, or a role-related field. And getting into an IT job without a computer science background is difficult;\\n\\n\\n\\nMeme on “experience vs job” (extracted from me.me\\n\\n\\n\\nBecause data engineering is the intersection of software engineering and data science, some employers prefer candidates with at least a bachelor’s degree in a related field such as computer science or data science;\\n\\n\\nThere are not many specific specializations or pos-degrees in data engineering. Only now colleges and universities are attracting more interest in the study of data engineering by offering specializations and bachelor’s degrees in the field. Here are some exceptions online, Data Engineering Zoomcamp and Learn Data Engineering.\\n\\n\\nData engineer jobs are relatively new, and the industry is rapidly changing, with new technologies being developed all the time. This is excellent for someone already familiar with the area, but it will be quite perplexing for a newcomer. (“The programming language A is better than the B”, “The cloud provider X is the best” 😨)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe number of tools for data engineering (Picture from the blog of the lake)\\n\\n\\n\\nMany companies give preference to hard skills rather than soft skills. So even if a professional is very dedicated and willing to learn it will be set aside for someone with some knowledge in IT;\\n\\n\\nPrejudice and bias. 😐 It is weird to think about it but there is still some bias among IT professionals against non-IT background professionals. It is strange to happen this in 2022 but it still happens (It occurred to me more than once…);\\n\\n\\nI will explain in the next section how you can try to overcome all these problems and get a data engineer job against the odds.\\n2. Some guidelines to get a data engineer job\\n2.1. Education, education, education!!!\\n\\n\\nHard skills in IT it is important to get a data engineer job so you need to learn some basics (picture from Jeko in Unsplash)\\n\\nAs previously said, one barrier to obtaining a position as a data engineer for someone without IT experience is the lack of IT hard skills/knowledge. So the solution is “simple,” but laborious: you must complete a large number of courses, boot camps, or other sorts of education that any data engineer requires. A comprehensive and well-designed course/specialization or Bootcamp will provide you with the essential tools you need to become a data engineer. This is a great option if you don’t want to go to college (and honestly, it’s expensive).\\n“But which topics should I learn to work as a data engineer?” you may ask. There are numerous articles, websites, and publications that detail the courses of study required to become a data engineer. One great article is this Data Engineering Roadmap For 2021 from Ben Rogojan (AKA Seattle Data Guy) or if you want something more visual you also have this Modern Data Engineer Roadmap by data stack. tv.\\nIn my humble point of view, you should first learn:\\n\\nCoding: This is a very important skill in data engineering. My favorite programming language is Python but Scala and Java are also widely used in data engineering. Choose one and learn the basics, the more important modules, and something of programming object-oriented;\\nSQL and database fundamentals: SQL is the most important database language and it is essential in data engineering. First, you should learn the basics of DML and DDL, then understand how a relational database is organized, and in an advanced way you should learn data warehousing;\\nTools provided in clouds: To be a good data engineer, you should be able to work with tools available from cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform). Nowadays it is important to know how to work with cloud storage (eg. AWS S3, Google Storage), with databases on the cloud (eg. Redshift, BigQuery), with tools for data orchestration (eg. Azure Data factory) or with tools regarding Spark (eg. Databricks). I advise you to know, at least, which tools the main three cloud providers have to offer;\\nSome other software knowledge: You should also know some bash commands, how to work with version control, and some knowledge regarding the basics of IT.\\n\\nTo learn all these contents you can access the multiple free MOOC platforms available. If you don’t know which one to choose from see my favorites here.\\n2.2. Show yourself with data projects\\n\\n\\nA good portfolio is mandatory if you have 0 experience in IT (picture from Joshua Aragon in Unsplash)\\n\\nLike in the meme presented before you know it is harder to get a job without experience but you will get experience with a job. So, how do we break this negative cycle? By doing some personal projects and creating a portfolio.\\nData engineering job applicants are frequently asked about their projects. If you’ve never worked as a data engineer, you can explain a project you worked on for a course or submitted to GitHub after doing some IT challenges like HackerRank or LeetCode.\\nYou can also volunteer for some associations that do IT jobs pro-bono. For example, I did a web scraper for the Data Science For Social Good Portugal.\\n\\n\\nData Science for Social Good Portugal is a community of volunteers in data science and data engineering (official logo)\\n\\nAlso, a good idea is to “show yourself” with certificates and certifications. In this article, I explained which are the best.\\n2.3. Be the best friend with networking\\n\\n\\nNetworking is very important nowadays (picture from Chris Montgomery in Unsplash)\\n\\nWe have a popular saying in Portugal “Who has friends will not die in prison!” that says that if you have a strong network you will have great advances in life (unfortunately some people take that saying to the extreme😒 ).\\nHow to build and maintain a solid network?\\n\\n\\nFirst of all, you need to follow Linkedin the best professionals in data science and data engineering. If you don’t know who they are check my article here.;\\n\\nThen you should use several platforms to show yourself. For example, after an achievement writes on Twitter: “Hello everyone, today I finished my 100 HackerRank challenge”;\\nYou must connect to recruiters or professionals in companies you like. After the first connection it is important to keep in touch with them;\\nLast but not least, In platforms with professional purposes like Linkedin or Landing. jobs you must always (!!!!) keep your CV updated.\\n\\n2.4. Learn from failure\\n\\n\\nFailure is important to learn (picture from Brett Jordan on Unsplash)\\n\\nThis is a very important guideline because if you think like this you will always win, it is a win-win situation. Just remember that learning from failure means that sometimes you win and sometimes you learn something that will lead to winning in job seeking.\\nHow can this be applied in job searching?\\nWhen looking for a new job and you fail you have to take the time to reflect on the “WHY” you were not successful in a particular job search and to use that information to make changes and improvements in your approach. This might involve analyzing the feedback you received from employers, assessing your job search strategy, and identifying areas where you can improve your skills or qualifications.\\nIn my case, I used this principle, especially in the technical interviews. When, during the technical interview, I was asked one theme of data engineering that I didn’t know how to answer I went to study that theme for the next technical interview.\\n2.5 Be resilient, persistent, patient, and never give up\\nI finished my Master’s in Engineering in 2007, and only in 2017, I got my first good and stable engineering job. During those 10 years, I’ve been unemployed, in a foreign country, working in a non-technical area, etc… You can see the history of my professional experience in my article Every Time I am Cleaning the Dishes I Remember Norway …\\n\\n\\n\"A river cuts through a rock not because of its power but because of its persistence.\" by James N Watkins (picture from Àlex Rodriguez in Unsplash)\\n\\nIf you read my article you may be thinking I am an optimistic and positive person but… “Au Contraire My Friend”, I am a very pessimistic person and always with negative thoughts but I am not a quitter!! 😁I was able to achieve my current position because I was very persistent, I had to be patient and resilient.\\nResilience and persistence are important when looking for a new job because the process can be challenging and unpredictable. It will be common for you to face rejection or to have to apply to many jobs before finding the right fit. Being resilient can help you stay motivated and keep trying, even when faced with setbacks.\\nOverall, being resilient and persistent can be a valuable asset in the job search process and in your career.\\nSummary\\nGetting a data engineer job may not be an easy task and straightforward, especially for someone without an IT background.\\nIn this article, I presented to you the main reasons why getting a data engineer position is hard and how you can surpass some difficulties by following these five pieces of advice:\\n\\n\\nEducation, education, education!!!\\n\\n\\nShow yourself with data projects\\n\\n\\nBe the best friend with networking\\n\\n\\nLearn from failure\\n\\n\\nBe resilient, persistent, patient, and never give up\\n\\n\\nAnd you, are you trying to get a data engineer position?\\nAre you following these pieces of advice?\\nGood luck 😉\\nDid you like this article?

       "   {'heading': 'Roles in a Team',\n",
       "    'body': 'A typical data team consists of the following roles: All these people work to create a data product. To explain the core responsibilities of each role, we will use a case scenario: Suppose we work at an online classifieds company. It’s a platform where users can go to sell things they don’t need (like OLX, where I work). If a user has an iPhone they want to sell — they go to this website, create a listing and sell their phone. On this platform, sellers sometimes have problems with identifying the correct category for the items they are selling. To help them, we want to build a service that suggests the best category. To sell their iPhone, the user creates a listing and the site needs to automatically understand that this iPhone has to go in the “mobile phones” category. Let’s start with the first role: product manager.'},\n",
       "   {'heading': 'Product Manager',\n",
       "    'body': 'A product manager is someone responsible for developing products. Their goal is to make sure that the team is building the right thing. They are typically less technical than the rest of the team: they don’t focus on the implementation aspects of a problem, but rather the problem itself. Product managers need to ensure that the product is actually used by the end-users. This is a common problem: in many companies, engineers create something that doesn’t solve real problems. Therefore, the product manager is somebody who speaks to the team on behalf of the users. The primary skills a PM needs to have are communication skills. For data scientists, communication is a soft skill, but for a product manager — it’s a hard skill. They have to have it to perform their work. Product managers also do a lot of planning: they need to understand the problem, come up with a solution, and make sure the solution is implemented in a timely manner. To accomplish this, PMs need to know what’s important and plan the work accordingly. When somebody has a problem, they approach the PM with it. Then the task of the PM is to figure out if users actually need this feature, how important this feature is, and if the team has the capacity to implement it. Let’s come back to our example. Suppose somebody comes to the PM and says: “We want to build a feature to automatically suggest the category for a listing. Somebody’s selling an iPhone, and we want to create a service that predicts that the item goes in the mobile phones category.” Product managers need to answer these questions: To answer these questions, PMs ask data analysts to help them figure out what to do next.'},\n",
       "   {'heading': 'Data Analyst',\n",
       "    'body': 'Data analysts know how to analyze the data available in the company. They discover insights in the data and then explain their findings to others. So, analysts need to know: Data analysts are also often responsible for defining key metrics and building different dashboards. This includes things like showing the company’s profits, displaying the number of listings, or how many contacts buyers made with sellers.  Thus, data analysts should know how to calculate all the important business metrics, and how to present them in a way that is understandable to others. When it comes to skills, data analysts should know: For our example, product managers turn to data analysts to help them quantify the extent of the problem. Together with the PM, the data analyst tries to answer questions like: After the analyst gets the data, analyzes it and answers these questions, they may conclude: “Yes, this is actually a problem”. Then the PM and the team discuss the repost and agree: “Indeed, this problem is actually worth solving”. Now the data team will go ahead and start solving this problem. After the model for the service is created, it’s necessary to understand if the service is effective: whether this model helps people and solves the problem. For that, data analysts usually run experiments — usually, A/B tests. When running an experiment, we can see if more users successfully finish posting an item for sale or if there are fewer ads that end up in the wrong category.'},\n",
       "   {'heading': 'Data Scientist',\n",
       "    'body': 'The roles of a data scientist and data analyst are pretty similar. In some companies, it’s the same person who does both jobs. However, data scientists typically focus more on predicting rather than explaining. A data analyst fetches the data, looks at it, explains what’s going on to the team, and gives some recommendations on what to do about it. A data scientist, on the other hand, focuses more on creating machine learning services. For example, one of the questions that a data scientist would want to answer is “How can we use this data to build a machine learning model for predicting something?” In other words, data scientists incorporate the data into the product. Their focus is more on engineering than analysis. Data scientists work more closely with engineers on integrating data solutions into the product. The skills of data scientists include: For our example, the data scientists are the people who develop the model used for predicting the category. Once they have a model, they can develop a simple web service for hosting this model.'},\n",
       "   {'heading': 'Data Engineers',\n",
       "    'body': 'Data engineers do all the heavy lifting when it comes to data. A lot of work needs to happen before data analysts can go to a database, fetch the data, perform their analysis, and come up with a report. This is precisely the focus of data engineers — they make sure this is possible. Their responsibility is to prepare all the necessary data in a form that is consumable for their colleagues. To accomplish this, data engineers create “a data lake”. All the data that users generate needs to be captured properly and saved in a separate database. This way, analysts can run their analysis, and data scientists can use this data for training models. Another thing data engineers often need to do, especially at larger companies, is to ensure that the people who look at the data have the necessary clearance to do so. Some user data is sensitive and people can’t just go looking around at personal information (such as emails or phone numbers) unless they have a really good reason to do so. Therefore, data engineers need to set up a system that doesn’t let people just access all the data at once. The skills needed for data engineers usually include: In our example, a data engineer prepares all the required data. First, they make sure the analyst has the data to perform the analysis. Then they also work with the data scientist to prepare the information that we’ll need for training the model. That includes the title of the listing, its description, the category, and so on. A data engineer isn’t the only type of engineer that a data team has. There are also machine learning engineers.'},\n",

       "    'body': 'Machine learning engineers take whatever data scientists build and help them scale it up. They also ensure that the service is maintainable and that the team follows the best engineering practices. Their focus is more on engineering than on modeling. The skills ML engineers have are similar to that of data engineers: Additionally, ML engineers work closely with more “traditional” engineers, like backend engineers, frontend engineers, or mobile engineers, to ensure that the services from the data team are included in the final product. For our example, ML engineers work together with data scientists on productionizing the category suggestion services. They make sure it’s stable once it’s rolled out to all the users. They must also ensure that it’s maintainable and it’s possible to make changes to the service in the future. There’s another kind of engineer that can be pretty important in a data team — site reliability engineers.'},\n",

       "    'body': 'The role of SREs is similar to the ML engineer, but the focus is more on the availability and reliability of the services. SREs aren’t strictly limited to working with data. Their role is more general: they tend to focus less on business logic and more on infrastructure, which includes things like networking and provisioning infrastructure. Therefore, SREs look after the servers where the services are running and take care of collecting all the operational metrics like CPU usage, how many requests per second there are, the services’ processes, and so on. As the name suggests, site reliability engineers have to make sure that everything runs reliably. They set up alerts and are constantly on call to make sure that the services are up and running without any interruptions. If something breaks, SREs quickly diagnose the problem and fix it, or involve an engineer to help find the solution. The skills needed for site reliability engineers: Of course, ML engineers and data engineers should also know these best practices, but the focus of DevOps engineers/SREs is to establish them and make sure that they are followed. There is a special type of DevOps engineer, called “MLOps engineer”.'},\n",

Similar to an SRE, the responsibility of an MLOps Engineer is to make sure that the services, developed by data scientists, ML engineers, and data engineers, are up and running all the time. MLOps engineers know the lifecycle of a machine learning model: the training phase, serving phase, and so on. Despite having this knowledge, MLOps Engineers are still focused more on operational support than on anything else. This means that they need to know and follow all the DevOps practices and make sure that the rest of the team is following them as well. They accomplish this by setting up things like continuous retraining, and CI/CD pipelines. Even though everyone in the team has a different focus, they all work together on achieving the same goal: solve the problems of the users.'},\n",

In fact, some companies firstly define the project and then start hiring, and other companies that do exactly the opposite. A good trade-off could be a combination of both, in the sense thatyou could start from a vision, which defines what the end goal should be, but the final product is still unclear. Although you could have in your mind your final goal, you may not know which features will lead to the final product. For this reason,you could start hiring different rolesthat would take you to that point to get a better understanding of your vision. The best way to find talented data scientists is through referrals from people you trust. Attend meetups and conferences related to data science and big data, and post job listings on relevant online communities and forums. Once you have a few candidates, it’s important to evaluate their skillset carefully. In addition to technical ability, you want to make sure they have strong communication skills and are able to work well in a team environment. The best way to assess these skills is through coding challenges and interviews that test both their technical abilities and soft skills. Building a data team can be a challenge, but it’s definitely doable with careful planning and execution. By keeping these tips in mind, you’ll be well on your way'},\n",

This can be a challenge, but if you have the right mix of people it can lead to a very strong team. The advantage of this approach is that each team member will be an expert in their own area and they’ll be able to bring a lot of knowledge to the table. If you decide to go with a team of generalists, the advantage of this approach is that everyone will have a good understanding of the whole data science process. In a startup, you should hire first generalists — people who can do pretty much everything.In fact, when you start, you have no lines of code. There’s nothing, which means you need to do back end, front end, DevOps, and whatever. Instead, if your company is already stable, probably you need more specialists, who focus on specific problems, such as tuning hyperparameters of a Machine Learning model. As your company grows, you may begin hiring more and more specialists and fewer generalists.'},\n",

But in general, we recommend hiring first the following three profiles, as shown in the following figure: At the beginning, you need people who can work on the prototype, who will write a lot of coding, and who will work on the product. It doesn’t make sense for you to hire a UX/UI designer when you have no work for them. Of course, every team is different, and you may find that you need to hire a different combination of roles depending on your unique circumstances.

While there are many different ways to go about this, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First, it’s important to find someone with the right skillset. You can look at thecandidate curriculum. A data scientist should be able to not only analyze data, but also understand how to use that data to solve real-world problems. Additionally, they should be well-versed in statistics and modeling, and be able to communicate their findings effectively. Once you’ve found a few candidates with the right skillset, it’s important tointerviewthem thoroughly. In addition to questions about their experience and qualifications, be sure to ask them about their approach to data science and how they would go about solving a specific problem. This will help you get a better sense of their thought process and whether or not they would be a good fit for your team. The interview should also include questions on personal experiences, to check whether that person is interesting or not. If someone is just plain boring, this is very difficult for the team. That person also needs a hobby, such as going to the cinema, doing some sports, or whatever. But that person needs to do something. You work more time with that person than you spend with your girlfriend or your wife. You spend more time with them than with the person that you love. So that’s why you need to understand that person really well. You could also include a second interview, which could be ahomework assignment. You could send out some homework, which is not very difficult. Then the candidate sends you the code, whether it is Jupyter Notebook or whatever. Then you should check it.

The specialization ofHydraulic and Water Resources Engineeringby the McGill University of Canada describes these two disciplines as follows: “Water resources engineeringis the quantitative study of the hydrologic cycle — the distribution and circulation of water linking the earth’s atmosphere, land and oceans. (…) Applications include the management of the urban water supply, the design of urban storm-sewer systems, and flood forecasting.”and“Hydraulic engineeringconsists of the application of fluid mechanics to water flowing in an isolated environment (pipe, pump) or in an open channel (river, lake, ocean). Applications include the design of hydraulic structures, such as sewage conduits, dams and breakwaters, the management of waterways, such as erosion protection and flood protection, and environmental management, such as prediction of the mixing and transport of pollutants in surface water.”. Therefore I’m considering hydraulic and water resources engineers need to guarantee (besides other tasks) a) the extraction of water from various sources, b) the correct water cleaning in water treatment facilities (see image above), c) good organization of the water in the correct storage structures, and d) quality/organization of all the end-to-end processes with several control tools.

Analysts are often thought of as “traditional” data scientists. They are highly skilled in statistics and modeling, and they use these skills to extract insights from data. Analysts are often very good at communicating their findings to non-technical audiences since they understand both the technical details and the business implications of their work. Initially, data analysts come from a very heavy research background. Over time the companies realized that these people were really rare. For this reason, currently, their actual study background doesn’t matter so much, it is more about their work experience. However, you can still have people with technical degrees, such as computer science degrees and statistics that would work as data analysts, although in most cases, these people fall in the Type B category. A data analyst performsdata analysis, being able to look at insights, do data visualization, make some dashboards, and try and figure out what’s going on with the data. That’s a very large component of data science. Another important skill for analysts isprogramming. Programming languages like R and Python are designed specifically for working with data. If you want to be able to manipulate data effectively, you need to know how to program. Third, you need to have anopen mind. Data science can be challenging, and it is important to be willing to learn new things. If you are closed-minded, you will likely find yourself struggling with data science. Last but not least, a good data analyst shouldbe curious. Once you have collected data, you should be curious about the data and start asking questions. Questions can lead to more questions, and this is how hypotheses are formed. For anyone who wants to improve their curiosity and keep learning more different things, you just have to make the decision that you want to learn more things. It’s as simple as that. Everyone can do their own version of curiosity.'},\n",

You do stuff in the cloud, set up the infrastructure, manage workflows, work with the data engineering team to make sure all the pipelines are solid, and force other members of your team to write clean code, unit tests, functional tests, and different things to make sure that the code will run in production. You can also think of them as the “new age machine learning engineers”. They build those systems and the Machine Learning ops, automated machine learning programs, and different things like that. One of the key differences between the Building type and the Analyst type is thatthe Building type always wants to work in the production environment. There’s almost a different mindset. As a Type B scientist, you should know frameworks like Git, Docker, and cloud computing platforms. These are important tools for managing and analyzing data. Gitis a version control system that lets you track changes to your code.Dockeris a tool that helps you package up your code so it can run in different environments.Cloud computing platformslike Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform provide scalable resources for storing and processing data. Type A and Type B have a quite different mindset. Type A is more exploratory, and Type B focuses more on production. The type A data scientist will be very happy to play around in Jupyter Notebooks: take data from a CSV file, explore and see what’s there, and try to apply some machine learning to it straight away — after figuring out what the problem is, of course. But the Type B data scientist doesn’t want to do that. They think of all of that stuff as a waste of time. They’re going to refactor it, to change it somehow.

Consultants are also experienced in working with a variety of different businesses, so they can quickly adapt to your company’s needs. Usually, type C scientists are eitherpeople leadersorproject managers. Or they’re very good at persuading and talking to business. If you’re a strong talker, you’re more likely to be a people leader. Usually, the type C data scientist will be your manager of data science, your head of data science, or your chief data scientist. There are different types of consultants as well. You can think of them as true consultants. They aren’t working very deep into the data. They’re talking about theprocess to solve problems, work closely with the stakeholders to figure out what the problems are and make sure that their concerns and issues are all addressed.

So the solution is “simple,” but laborious: you must complete a large number of courses, boot camps, or other sorts of education that any data engineer requires. A comprehensive and well-designed course/specialization or Bootcamp will provide you with the essential tools you need to become a data engineer. This is a great option if you don’t want to go to college (and honestly, it’s expensive). “But which topics should I learn to work as a data engineer?” you may ask. There are numerous articles, websites, and publications that detail the courses of study required to become a data engineer. One great article is thisData Engineering Roadmap For 2021fromBen Rogojan(AKA Seattle Data Guy) or if you want something more visual you also have thisModern Data Engineer Roadmapbydata stack. tv. In my humble point of view, you should first learn: To learn all these contents you can access the multiple free MOOC platforms available. If you don’t know which one to choose from see my favoriteshere. Like in the meme presented before you know it is harder to get a job without experience but you will get experience with a job. So, how do we break this negative cycle? By doing some personal projects and creating a portfolio. Data engineering job applicants are frequently asked about their projects. If you’ve never worked as a data engineer, you can explain a project you worked on for a course or submitted to GitHub after doing some IT challenges likeHackerRankorLeetCode. You can also volunteer for some associations that do IT jobs pro-bono. For example, I did a web scraper for theData Science For Social Good Portugal. Also, a good idea is to “show yourself” with certificates and certifications. In thisarticle, I explained which are the best. We have a popular saying in Portugal “Who has friends will not die in prison!” that says that if you have a strong network you will have great advances in life (unfortunately some people take that saying to the extreme😒 ). How to build and maintain a solid network? This is a very important guideline because if you think like this you will always win, it is a win-win situation. Just remember that learning from failure means that sometimes you win and sometimes you learn something that will lead to winning in job seeking. How can this be applied in job searching? When looking for a new job and you fail you have to take the time to reflect on the “WHY” you were not successful in a particular job search and to use that information to make changes and improvements in your approach. This might involve analyzing the feedback you received from employers, assessing your job search strategy, and identifying areas where you can improve your skills or qualifications. In my case, I used this principle, especially in the technical interviews. When, during the technical interview, I was asked one theme of data engineering that I didn’t know how to answer I went to study that theme for the next technical interview. I finished my Master’s in Engineering in 2007, and only in 2017, I got my first good and stable engineering job. During those 10 years, I’ve been unemployed, in a foreign country, working in a non-technical area, etc… You can see the history of my professional experience in my articleEvery Time I am Cleaning the Dishes I Remember Norway … If you read my article you may be thinking I am an optimistic and positive person but… “Au Contraire My Friend”, I am a very pessimistic person and always with negative thoughts but I amnot a quitter!! 😁I was able to achieve my current position because I was very persistent, I had to be patient and resilient. Resilience and persistence are important when looking for a new job because the process can be challenging and unpredictable. It will be common for you to face rejection or to have to apply to many jobs before finding the right fit. Being resilient can help you stay motivated and keep trying, even when faced with setbacks. Overall, being resilient and persistent can be a valuable asset in the job search process and in your career.'},\n",

To explain the core responsibilities of each role, we will use a case scenario: Suppose we work at an online classifieds company. It’s a platform where users can go to sell things they don’t need (like OLX, where I work). If a user has an iPhone they want to sell — they go to this website, create a listing and sell their phone. On this platform, sellers sometimes have problems with identifying the correct category for the items they are selling. To help them, we want to build a service that suggests the best category. To sell their iPhone, the user creates a listing and the site needs to automatically understand that this iPhone has to go in the “mobile phones” category. Let’s start with the first role: product manager.'},\n",

They are typically less technical than the rest of the team: they don’t focus on the implementation aspects of a problem, but rather the problem itself. Product managers need to ensure that the product is actually used by the end-users. This is a common problem: in many companies, engineers create something that doesn’t solve real problems. Therefore, the product manager is somebody who speaks to the team on behalf of the users. The primary skills a PM needs to have are communication skills. For data scientists, communication is a soft skill, but for a product manager — it’s a hard skill. They have to have it to perform their work. Product managers also do a lot of planning: they need to understand the problem, come up with a solution, and make sure the solution is implemented in a timely manner. To accomplish this, PMs need to know what’s important and plan the work accordingly. When somebody has a problem, they approach the PM with it. Then the task of the PM is to figure out if users actually need this feature, how important this feature is, and if the team has the capacity to implement it. Let’s come back to our example. Suppose somebody comes to the PM and says: “We want to build a feature to automatically suggest the category for a listing. Somebody’s selling an iPhone, and we want to create a service that predicts that the item goes in the mobile phones category.” Product managers need to answer these questions: To answer these questions, PMs ask data analysts to help them figure out what to do next.'},\n",

Thus, data analysts should know how to calculate all the important business metrics, and how to present them in a way that is understandable to others. When it comes to skills, data analysts should know: For our example, product managers turn to data analysts to help them quantify the extent of the problem. Together with the PM, the data analyst tries to answer questions like: After the analyst gets the data, analyzes it and answers these questions, they may conclude: “Yes, this is actually a problem”. Then the PM and the team discuss the repost and agree: “Indeed, this problem is actually worth solving”. Now the data team will go ahead and start solving this problem. After the model for the service is created, it’s necessary to understand if the service is effective: whether this model helps people and solves the problem. For that, data analysts usually run experiments — usually, A/B tests. When running an experiment, we can see if more users successfully finish posting an item for sale or if there are fewer ads that end up in the wrong category.'},\n",

A data scientist, on the other hand, focuses more on creating machine learning services. For example, one of the questions that a data scientist would want to answer is “How can we use this data to build a machine learning model for predicting something?” In other words, data scientists incorporate the data into the product. Their focus is more on engineering than analysis. Data scientists work more closely with engineers on integrating data solutions into the product.

To accomplish this, data engineers create “a data lake”. All the data that users generate needs to be captured properly and saved in a separate database. This way, analysts can run their analysis, and data scientists can use this data for training models. Another thing data engineers often need to do, especially at larger companies, is to ensure that the people who look at the data have the necessary clearance to do so. Some user data is sensitive and people can’t just go looking around at personal information (such as emails or phone numbers) unless they have a really good reason to do so. Therefore, data engineers need to set up a system that doesn’t let people just access all the data at once.

While there are many different ways to go about this, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First, it’s important to find someone with the right skillset. You can look at thecandidate curriculum. A data scientist should be able to not only analyze data, but also understand how to use that data to solve real-world problems. Additionally, they should be well-versed in statistics and modeling, and be able to communicate their findings effectively. Once you’ve found a few candidates with the right skillset, it’s important tointerviewthem thoroughly. In addition to questions about their experience and qualifications, be sure to ask them about their approach to data science and how they would go about solving a specific problem. This will help you get a better sense of their thought process and whether or not they would be a good fit for your team. The interview should also include questions on personal experiences, to check whether that person is interesting or not. If someone is just plain boring, this is very difficult for the team. That person also needs a hobby, such as going to the cinema, doing some sports, or whatever. But that person needs to do something. You work more time with that person than you spend with your girlfriend or your wife. You spend more time with them than with the person that you love. So that’s why you need to understand that person really well. You could also include a second interview, which could be ahomework assignment. You could send out some homework, which is not very difficult. Then the candidate sends you the code, whether it is Jupyter Notebook or whatever. Then you should check it. From this simple task, you could already see how much people are working.'},\n",

According to theOxford English Dictionary, an engineer is“someone who designs, builds or maintains engines, machines, or structures”. Each role may focus on different resources/products/processes, “water” for hydraulic and water resources engineers, and “data” for data engineers but both handle engineering on it. They are more “thinking” roles than “manual” roles (like a plumber) since they have to reflect and calculate what are the best solutions for their processes and not act by simple guidelines.'},\n",

For example, a mechanical engineer has the working scope to build, maintain and improve mechanical machines that will perform some tasks. I’m considering a data engineer has the objective of building, maintaining, and improving data pipelines (ETL or ELT processes), data storage structures (data warehouses or data lakes), and providing solid data to the stakeholders. In a detailed way, the professional has the working scope of guarantee the a) extraction of data from various sources (both internal like relational databases and external sources), b) transformation of data using solid programming skills or software, c) good organization of the data in the correct storage structures and d) quality/organization of all the end-to-end processes and data using orchestrator tools, monitoring tools or other control tools. A data engineer needs to think of the process as a whole considering downstream and upstream mechanisms. The specialization ofHydraulic and Water Resources Engineeringby the McGill University of Canada describes these two disciplines as follows: “Water resources engineeringis the quantitative study of the hydrologic cycle — the distribution and circulation of water linking the earth’s atmosphere, land and oceans. (…) Applications include the management of the urban water supply, the design of urban storm-sewer systems, and flood forecasting.”and“Hydraulic engineeringconsists of the application of fluid mechanics to water flowing in an isolated environment (pipe, pump) or in an open channel (river, lake, ocean). Applications include the design of hydraulic structures, such as sewage conduits, dams and breakwaters, the management of waterways, such as erosion protection and flood protection, and environmental management, such as prediction of the mixing and transport of pollutants in surface water.”. Therefore I’m considering hydraulic and water resources engineers need to guarantee (besides other tasks) a) the extraction of water from various sources, b) the correct water cleaning in water treatment facilities (see image above), c) good organization of the water in the correct storage structures, and d) quality/organization of all the end-to-end processes with several control tools. In the table below it is possible to see how identical both roles are in terms of working processes, tasks, or goals (with some examples). Therefore you can see that even having different targets both engineers do similar tasks.'},\n",

Analysts are often thought of as “traditional” data scientists. They are highly skilled in statistics and modeling, and they use these skills to extract insights from data. Analysts are often very good at communicating their findings to non-technical audiences since they understand both the technical details and the business implications of their work. Initially, data analysts come from a very heavy research background. Over time the companies realized that these people were really rare. For this reason, currently, their actual study background doesn’t matter so much, it is more about their work experience. However, you can still have people with technical degrees, such as computer science degrees and statistics that would work as data analysts, although in most cases, these people fall in the Type B category. A data analyst performsdata analysis, being able to look at insights, do data visualization, make some dashboards, and try and figure out what’s going on with the data. That’s a very large component of data science. Another important skill for analysts isprogramming. Programming languages like R and Python are designed specifically for working with data. If you want to be able to manipulate data effectively, you need to know how to program. Third, you need to have anopen mind. Data science can be challenging, and it is important to be willing to learn new things. If you are closed-minded, you will likely find yourself struggling with data science. Last but not least, a good data analyst shouldbe curious. Once you have collected data, you should be curious about the data and start asking questions. Questions can lead to more questions, and this is how hypotheses are formed. For anyone who wants to improve their curiosity and keep learning more different things, you just have to make the decision that you want to learn more things. It’s as simple as that. Everyone can do their own version of curiosity.'},\n",

You can also think of them as the “new age machine learning engineers”. They build those systems and the Machine Learning ops, automated machine learning programs, and different things like that. One of the key differences between the Building type and the Analyst type is thatthe Building type always wants to work in the production environment. There’s almost a different mindset. As a Type B scientist, you should know frameworks like Git, Docker, and cloud computing platforms. These are important tools for managing and analyzing data. Gitis a version control system that lets you track changes to your code.Dockeris a tool that helps you package up your code so it can run in different environments.Cloud computing platformslike Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform provide scalable resources for storing and processing data. Type A and Type B have a quite different mindset. Type A is more exploratory, and Type B focuses more on production.

So the solution is “simple,” but laborious: you must complete a large number of courses, boot camps, or other sorts of education that any data engineer requires. A comprehensive and well-designed course/specialization or Bootcamp will provide you with the essential tools you need to become a data engineer. This is a great option if you don’t want to go to college (and honestly, it’s expensive). “But which topics should I learn to work as a data engineer?” you may ask. There are numerous articles, websites, and publications that detail the courses of study required to become a data engineer. One great article is thisData Engineering Roadmap For 2021fromBen Rogojan(AKA Seattle Data Guy) or if you want something more visual you also have thisModern Data Engineer Roadmapbydata stack. tv. In my humble point of view, you should first learn: To learn all these contents you can access the multiple free MOOC platforms available. If you don’t know which one to choose from see my favoriteshere. Like in the meme presented before you know it is harder to get a job without experience but you will get experience with a job. So, how do we break this negative cycle? By doing some personal projects and creating a portfolio. Data engineering job applicants are frequently asked about their projects. If you’ve never worked as a data engineer, you can explain a project you worked on for a course or submitted to GitHub after doing some IT challenges likeHackerRankorLeetCode. You can also volunteer for some associations that do IT jobs pro-bono. For example, I did a web scraper for theData Science For Social Good Portugal. Also, a good idea is to “show yourself” with certificates and certifications. In thisarticle, I explained which are the best. We have a popular saying in Portugal “Who has friends will not die in prison!” that says that if you have a strong network you will have great advances in life (unfortunately some people take that saying to the extreme😒 ). How to build and maintain a solid network? This is a very important guideline because if you think like this you will always win, it is a win-win situation. Just remember that learning from failure means that sometimes you win and sometimes you learn something that will lead to winning in job seeking. How can this be applied in job searching? When looking for a new job and you fail you have to take the time to reflect on the “WHY” you were not successful in a particular job search and to use that information to make changes and improvements in your approach. This might involve analyzing the feedback you received from employers, assessing your job search strategy, and identifying areas where you can improve your skills or qualifications. In my case, I used this principle, especially in the technical interviews. When, during the technical interview, I was asked one theme of data engineering that I didn’t know how to answer I went to study that theme for the next technical interview. I finished my Master’s in Engineering in 2007, and only in 2017, I got my first good and stable engineering job. During those 10 years, I’ve been unemployed, in a foreign country, working in a non-technical area, etc… You can see the history of my professional experience in my articleEvery Time I am Cleaning the Dishes I Remember Norway … If you read my article you may be thinking I am an optimistic and positive person but… “Au Contraire My Friend”, I am a very pessimistic person and always with negative thoughts but I amnot a quitter!! 😁I was able to achieve my current position because I was very persistent, I had to be patient and resilient. Resilience and persistence are important when looking for a new job because the process can be challenging and unpredictable. It will be common for you to face rejection or to have to apply to many jobs before finding the right fit. Being resilient can help you stay motivated and keep trying, even when faced with setbacks. Overall, being resilient and persistent can be a valuable asset in the job search process and in your career.'},\n",
