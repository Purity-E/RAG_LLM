       "  'When building a data science team, it can be difficult to decide who to hire first. The answer, of course, depends on your specific needs. But in general, we recommend hiring first the following three profiles, as shown in the following figure: At the beginning, you need people who can work on the prototype, who will write a lot of coding, and who will work on the product. It doesn’t make sense for you to hire a UX/UI designer when you have no work for them. Of course, every team is different, and you may find that you need to hire a different combination of roles depending on your unique circumstances. So you really need to understand, at which stage you are. And what kind of roles do you need now to solve this problem.',\n",

While there are many different ways to go about this, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First, it’s important to find someone with the right skillset. You can look at thecandidate curriculum. A data scientist should be able to not only analyze data, but also understand how to use that data to solve real-world problems. Additionally, they should be well-versed in statistics and modeling, and be able to communicate their findings effectively. Once you’ve found a few candidates with the right skillset, it’s important tointerviewthem thoroughly. In addition to questions about their experience and qualifications, be sure to ask them about their approach to data science and how they would go about solving a specific problem. This will help you get a better sense of their thought process and whether or not they would be a good fit for your team. The interview should also include questions on personal experiences, to check whether that person is interesting or not. If someone is just plain boring, this is very difficult for the team. That person also needs a hobby, such as going to the cinema, doing some sports, or whatever. But that person needs to do something. You work more time with that person than you spend with your girlfriend or your wife. You spend more time with them than with the person that you love. So that’s why you need to understand that person really well. You could also include a second interview, which could be ahomework assignment. You could send out some homework, which is not very difficult. Then the candidate sends you the code, whether it is Jupyter Notebook or whatever. Then you should check it. From this simple task, you could already see how much people are working.',\n",

For example, a mechanical engineer has the working scope to build, maintain and improve mechanical machines that will perform some tasks. I’m considering a data engineer has the objective of building, maintaining, and improving data pipelines (ETL or ELT processes), data storage structures (data warehouses or data lakes), and providing solid data to the stakeholders. In a detailed way, the professional has the working scope of guarantee the a) extraction of data from various sources (both internal like relational databases and external sources), b) transformation of data using solid programming skills or software, c) good organization of the data in the correct storage structures and d) quality/organization of all the end-to-end processes and data using orchestrator tools, monitoring tools or other control tools. A data engineer needs to think of the process as a whole considering downstream and upstream mechanisms. The specialization ofHydraulic and Water Resources Engineeringby the McGill University of Canada describes these two disciplines as follows: “Water resources engineeringis the quantitative study of the hydrologic cycle — the distribution and circulation of water linking the earth’s atmosphere, land and oceans. (…) Applications include the management of the urban water supply, the design of urban storm-sewer systems, and flood forecasting.”and“Hydraulic engineeringconsists of the application of fluid mechanics to water flowing in an isolated environment (pipe, pump) or in an open channel (river, lake, ocean). Applications include the design of hydraulic structures, such as sewage conduits, dams and breakwaters, the management of waterways, such as erosion protection and flood protection, and environmental management, such as prediction of the mixing and transport of pollutants in surface water.”. Therefore I’m considering hydraulic and water resources engineers need to guarantee (besides other tasks) a) the extraction of water from various sources, b) the correct water cleaning in water treatment facilities (see image above), c) good organization of the water in the correct storage structures, and d) quality/organization of all the end-to-end processes with several control tools.

       "  'body': 'Data analysts know how to analyze the data available in the company. They discover insights in the data and then explain their findings to others. So, analysts need to know: Data analysts are also often responsible for defining key metrics and building different dashboards. This includes things like showing the company’s profits, displaying the number of listings, or how many contacts buyers made with sellers.  Thus, data analysts should know how to calculate all the important business metrics, and how to present them in a way that is understandable to others. When it comes to skills, data analysts should know: For our example, product managers turn to data analysts to help them quantify the extent of the problem. Together with the PM, the data analyst tries to answer questions like: After the analyst gets the data, analyzes it and answers these questions, they may conclude: “Yes, this is actually a problem”. Then the PM and the team discuss the repost and agree: “Indeed, this problem is actually worth solving”. Now the data team will go ahead and start solving this problem. After the model for the service is created, it’s necessary to understand if the service is effective: whether this model helps people and solves the problem. For that, data analysts usually run experiments — usually, A/B tests. When running an experiment, we can see if more users successfully finish posting an item for sale or if there are fewer ads that end up in the wrong category.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Data engineers do all the heavy lifting when it comes to data. A lot of work needs to happen before data analysts can go to a database, fetch the data, perform their analysis, and come up with a report. This is precisely the focus of data engineers — they make sure this is possible. Their responsibility is to prepare all the necessary data in a form that is consumable for their colleagues. To accomplish this, data engineers create “a data lake”. All the data that users generate needs to be captured properly and saved in a separate database. This way, analysts can run their analysis, and data scientists can use this data for training models. Another thing data engineers often need to do, especially at larger companies, is to ensure that the people who look at the data have the necessary clearance to do so. Some user data is sensitive and people can’t just go looking around at personal information (such as emails or phone numbers) unless they have a really good reason to do so. Therefore, data engineers need to set up a system that doesn’t let people just access all the data at once. The skills needed for data engineers usually include: In our example, a data engineer prepares all the required data. First, they make sure the analyst has the data to perform the analysis. Then they also work with the data scientist to prepare the information that we’ll need for training the model. That includes the title of the listing, its description, the category, and so on. A data engineer isn’t the only type of engineer that a data team has. There are also machine learning engineers.',\n",
