To explain the core responsibilities of each role, we will use a case scenario: Suppose we work at an online classifieds company. It\u2019s a platform where users can go to sell things they don\u2019t need (like OLX, where I work). If a user has an iPhone they want to sell \u2014 they go to this website, create a listing and sell their phone. On this platform, sellers sometimes have problems with identifying the correct category for the items they are selling. To help them, we want to build a service that suggests the best category. To sell their iPhone, the user creates a listing and the site needs to automatically understand that this iPhone has to go in the \u201cmobile phones\u201d category. Let\u2019s start with the first role: product manager."

                "body": "A product manager is someone responsible for developing products. Their goal is to make sure that the team is building the right thing. They are typically less technical than the rest of the team: they don\u2019t focus on the implementation aspects of a problem, but rather the problem itself. Product managers need to ensure that the product is actually used by the end-users. This is a common problem: in many companies, engineers create something that doesn\u2019t solve real problems. Therefore, the product manager is somebody who speaks to the team on behalf of the users. The primary skills a PM needs to have are communication skills. For data scientists, communication is a soft skill, but for a product manager \u2014 it\u2019s a hard skill. They have to have it to perform their work. Product managers also do a lot of planning: they need to understand the problem, come up with a solution, and make sure the solution is implemented in a timely manner. To accomplish this, PMs need to know what\u2019s important and plan the work accordingly. When somebody has a problem, they approach the PM with it. Then the task of the PM is to figure out if users actually need this feature, how important this feature is, and if the team has the capacity to implement it. Let\u2019s come back to our example. Suppose somebody comes to the PM and says: \u201cWe want to build a feature to automatically suggest the category for a listing. Somebody\u2019s selling an iPhone, and we want to create a service that predicts that the item goes in the mobile phones category.\u201d Product managers need to answer these questions: To answer these questions, PMs ask data analysts to help them figure out what to do next."

So, analysts need to know: Data analysts are also often responsible for defining key metrics and building different dashboards. This includes things like showing the company\u2019s profits, displaying the number of listings, or how many contacts buyers made with sellers.  Thus, data analysts should know how to calculate all the important business metrics, and how to present them in a way that is understandable to others. When it comes to skills, data analysts should know: For our example, product managers turn to data analysts to help them quantify the extent of the problem. Together with the PM, the data analyst tries to answer questions like: After the analyst gets the data, analyzes it and answers these questions, they may conclude: \u201cYes, this is actually a problem\u201d. Then the PM and the team discuss the repost and agree: \u201cIndeed, this problem is actually worth solving\u201d. Now the data team will go ahead and start solving this problem. After the model for the service is created, it\u2019s necessary to understand if the service is effective: whether this model helps people and solves the problem. For that, data analysts usually run experiments \u2014 usually, A/B tests. When running an experiment, we can see if more users successfully finish posting an item for sale or if there are fewer ads that end up in the wrong category."

However, data scientists typically focus more on predicting rather than explaining. A data analyst fetches the data, looks at it, explains what\u2019s going on to the team, and gives some recommendations on what to do about it. A data scientist, on the other hand, focuses more on creating machine learning services. For example, one of the questions that a data scientist would want to answer is \u201cHow can we use this data to build a machine learning model for predicting something?\u201d In other words, data scientists incorporate the data into the product. Their focus is more on engineering than analysis. Data scientists work more closely with engineers on integrating data solutions into the product. The skills of data scientists include: For our example, the data scientists are the people who develop the model used for predicting the category. Once they have a model, they can develop a simple web service for hosting this model."

A lot of work needs to happen before data analysts can go to a database, fetch the data, perform their analysis, and come up with a report. This is precisely the focus of data engineers \u2014 they make sure this is possible. Their responsibility is to prepare all the necessary data in a form that is consumable for their colleagues. To accomplish this, data engineers create \u201ca data lake\u201d. All the data that users generate needs to be captured properly and saved in a separate database. This way, analysts can run their analysis, and data scientists can use this data for training models. Another thing data engineers often need to do, especially at larger companies, is to ensure that the people who look at the data have the necessary clearance to do so. Some user data is sensitive and people can\u2019t just go looking around at personal information (such as emails or phone numbers) unless they have a really good reason to do so. Therefore, data engineers need to set up a system that doesn\u2019t let people just access all the data at once. The skills needed for data engineers usually include: In our example, a data engineer prepares all the required data. First, they make sure the analyst has the data to perform the analysis. Then they also work with the data scientist to prepare the information that we\u2019ll need for training the model. That includes the title of the listing, its description, the category, and so on. A data engineer isn\u2019t the only type of engineer that a data team has. There are also machine learning engineers."

For our example, ML engineers work together with data scientists on productionizing the category suggestion services. They make sure it\u2019s stable once it\u2019s rolled out to all the users. They must also ensure that it\u2019s maintainable and it\u2019s possible to make changes to the service in the future.

SREs aren\u2019t strictly limited to working with data. Their role is more general: they tend to focus less on business logic and more on infrastructure, which includes things like networking and provisioning infrastructure. Therefore, SREs look after the servers where the services are running and take care of collecting all the operational metrics like CPU usage, how many requests per second there are, the services\u2019 processes, and so on. As the name suggests, site reliability engineers have to make sure that everything runs reliably. They set up alerts and are constantly on call to make sure that the services are up and running without any interruptions. If something breaks, SREs quickly diagnose the problem and fix it, or involve an engineer to help find the solution. The skills needed for site reliability engineers: Of course, ML engineers and data engineers should also know these best practices, but the focus of DevOps engineers/SREs is to establish them and make sure that they are followed.

MLOps engineers know the lifecycle of a machine learning model: the training phase, serving phase, and so on. Despite having this knowledge, MLOps Engineers are still focused more on operational support than on anything else. This means that they need to know and follow all the DevOps practices and make sure that the rest of the team is following them as well.

For this reason,you could start hiring different rolesthat would take you to that point to get a better understanding of your vision. The best way to find talented data scientists is through referrals from people you trust. Attend meetups and conferences related to data science and big data, and post job listings on relevant online communities and forums. Once you have a few candidates, it\u2019s important to evaluate their skillset carefully. In addition to technical ability, you want to make sure they have strong communication skills and are able to work well in a team environment.

You can look at thecandidate curriculum. A data scientist should be able to not only analyze data, but also understand how to use that data to solve real-world problems. Additionally, they should be well-versed in statistics and modeling, and be able to communicate their findings effectively. Once you\u2019ve found a few candidates with the right skillset, it\u2019s important tointerviewthem thoroughly. In addition to questions about their experience and qualifications, be sure to ask them about their approach to data science and how they would go about solving a specific problem. This will help you get a better sense of their thought process and whether or not they would be a good fit for your team. The interview should also include questions on personal experiences, to check whether that person is interesting or not. If someone is just plain boring, this is very difficult for the team. That person also needs a hobby, such as going to the cinema, doing some sports, or whatever. But that person needs to do something. You work more time with that person than you spend with your girlfriend or your wife. You spend more time with them than with the person that you love. So that\u2019s why you need to understand that person really well. You could also include a second interview, which could be ahomework assignment. You could send out some homework, which is not very difficult. Then the candidate sends you the code, whether it is Jupyter Notebook or whatever. Then you should check it. From this simple task, you could already see how much people are working."

In a detailed way, the professional has the working scope of guarantee the a) extraction of data from various sources (both internal like relational databases and external sources), b) transformation of data using solid programming skills or software, c) good organization of the data in the correct storage structures and d) quality/organization of all the end-to-end processes and data using orchestrator tools, monitoring tools or other control tools. A data engineer needs to think of the process as a whole considering downstream and upstream mechanisms. The specialization ofHydraulic and Water Resources Engineeringby the McGill University of Canada describes these two disciplines as follows: \u201cWater resources engineeringis the quantitative study of the hydrologic cycle \u2014 the distribution and circulation of water linking the earth\u2019s atmosphere, land and oceans. (\u2026) Applications include the management of the urban water supply, the design of urban storm-sewer systems, and flood forecasting.\u201dand\u201cHydraulic engineeringconsists of the application of fluid mechanics to water flowing in an isolated environment (pipe, pump) or in an open channel (river, lake, ocean). Applications include the design of hydraulic structures, such as sewage conduits, dams and breakwaters, the management of waterways, such as erosion protection and flood protection, and environmental management, such as prediction of the mixing and transport of pollutants in surface water.\u201d. Therefore I\u2019m considering hydraulic and water resources engineers need to guarantee (besides other tasks) a) the extraction of water from various sources, b) the correct water cleaning in water treatment facilities (see image above), c) good organization of the water in the correct storage structures, and d) quality/organization of all the end-to-end processes with several control tools. In the table below it is possible to see how identical both roles are in terms of working processes, tasks, or goals (with some examples). Therefore you can see that even having different targets both engineers do similar tasks."

Analysts are often thought of as \u201ctraditional\u201d data scientists. They are highly skilled in statistics and modeling, and they use these skills to extract insights from data. Analysts are often very good at communicating their findings to non-technical audiences since they understand both the technical details and the business implications of their work. Initially, data analysts come from a very heavy research background. Over time the companies realized that these people were really rare. For this reason, currently, their actual study background doesn\u2019t matter so much, it is more about their work experience. However, you can still have people with technical degrees, such as computer science degrees and statistics that would work as data analysts, although in most cases, these people fall in the Type B category. A data analyst performsdata analysis, being able to look at insights, do data visualization, make some dashboards, and try and figure out what\u2019s going on with the data. That\u2019s a very large component of data science. Another important skill for analysts isprogramming. Programming languages like R and Python are designed specifically for working with data. If you want to be able to manipulate data effectively, you need to know how to program. Third, you need to have anopen mind. Data science can be challenging, and it is important to be willing to learn new things. If you are closed-minded, you will likely find yourself struggling with data science. Last but not least, a good data analyst shouldbe curious. Once you have collected data, you should be curious about the data and start asking questions. Questions can lead to more questions, and this is how hypotheses are formed. For anyone who wants to improve their curiosity and keep learning more different things, you just have to make the decision that you want to learn more things. It\u2019s as simple as that. Everyone can do their own version of curiosity."

You do stuff in the cloud, set up the infrastructure, manage workflows, work with the data engineering team to make sure all the pipelines are solid, and force other members of your team to write clean code, unit tests, functional tests, and different things to make sure that the code will run in production. You can also think of them as the \u201cnew age machine learning engineers\u201d. They build those systems and the Machine Learning ops, automated machine learning programs, and different things like that. One of the key differences between the Building type and the Analyst type is thatthe Building type always wants to work in the production environment. There\u2019s almost a different mindset. As a Type B scientist, you should know frameworks like Git, Docker, and cloud computing platforms. These are important tools for managing and analyzing data. Gitis a version control system that lets you track changes to your code.Dockeris a tool that helps you package up your code so it can run in different environments.Cloud computing platformslike Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform provide scalable resources for storing and processing data. Type A and Type B have a quite different mindset. Type A is more exploratory, and Type B focuses more on production. The type A data scientist will be very happy to play around in Jupyter Notebooks: take data from a CSV file, explore and see what\u2019s there, and try to apply some machine learning to it straight away \u2014 after figuring out what the problem is, of course. But the Type B data scientist doesn\u2019t want to do that. They think of all of that stuff as a waste of time. They\u2019re going to refactor it, to change it somehow. The following figure shows the technical skills required for Types A and B:"

Consultants are also experienced in working with a variety of different businesses, so they can quickly adapt to your company\u2019s needs. Usually, type C scientists are eitherpeople leadersorproject managers. Or they\u2019re very good at persuading and talking to business. If you\u2019re a strong talker, you\u2019re more likely to be a people leader. Usually, the type C data scientist will be your manager of data science, your head of data science, or your chief data scientist. There are different types of consultants as well. You can think of them as true consultants. They aren\u2019t working very deep into the data. They\u2019re talking about theprocess to solve problems, work closely with the stakeholders to figure out what the problems are and make sure that their concerns and issues are all addressed.

This is true to some extent \u2014 if you want to be a data scientist working on medical data, it helps to have a background in medicine. However, domain expertise is not always necessary to get started in data science. As a fresher, breaking into the data science field can seem daunting. However, with the right attitude and some hard work, it is definitely possible to make a name for yourself in this exciting and ever-growing industry. Here are a few tips on how to get started: 1.Learn Python or R.These are the two most popular programming languages for data science and are relatively easy to learn compared to other languages. 2.Get familiar with basic statistical concepts.Understanding means, median, mode, variance, etc. will be helpful in your journey to becoming a data scientist. 3.Start playing around with data!Use public datasets to practice your new skills or try out different data analysis techniques. Kaggle is a great resource for finding datasets and participating in competitions. 4.Learn Machine Learning.This is a huge field of study within data science and can seem daunting at first, but there are plenty of resources available to help you get started (including our own course!). 5.Networkingis another key component of breaking into data science. Attend meetups and conferences, and connect with people already working in the field \u2014 they may be able to offer advice or even help you land your first job. 6.Stay up to date with the latest newsand advancements in data science.

                "body": "As previously said, one barrier to obtaining a position as a data engineer for someone without IT experience is the lack of IT hard skills/knowledge. So the solution is \u201csimple,\u201d but laborious: you must complete a large number of courses, boot camps, or other sorts of education that any data engineer requires. A comprehensive and well-designed course/specialization or Bootcamp will provide you with the essential tools you need to become a data engineer. This is a great option if you don\u2019t want to go to college (and honestly, it\u2019s expensive). \u201cBut which topics should I learn to work as a data engineer?\u201d you may ask. There are numerous articles, websites, and publications that detail the courses of study required to become a data engineer. One great article is thisData Engineering Roadmap For 2021fromBen Rogojan(AKA Seattle Data Guy) or if you want something more visual you also have thisModern Data Engineer Roadmapbydata stack. tv. In my humble point of view, you should first learn: To learn all these contents you can access the multiple free MOOC platforms available. If you don\u2019t know which one to choose from see my favoriteshere. Like in the meme presented before you know it is harder to get a job without experience but you will get experience with a job. So, how do we break this negative cycle? By doing some personal projects and creating a portfolio. Data engineering job applicants are frequently asked about their projects. If you\u2019ve never worked as a data engineer, you can explain a project you worked on for a course or submitted to GitHub after doing some IT challenges likeHackerRankorLeetCode. You can also volunteer for some associations that do IT jobs pro-bono. For example, I did a web scraper for theData Science For Social Good Portugal. Also, a good idea is to \u201cshow yourself\u201d with certificates and certifications. In thisarticle, I explained which are the best. We have a popular saying in Portugal \u201cWho has friends will not die in prison!\u201d that says that if you have a strong network you will have great advances in life (unfortunately some people take that saying to the extreme\ud83d\ude12 ). How to build and maintain a solid network? This is a very important guideline because if you think like this you will always win, it is a win-win situation. Just remember that learning from failure means that sometimes you win and sometimes you learn something that will lead to winning in job seeking. How can this be applied in job searching? When looking for a new job and you fail you have to take the time to reflect on the \u201cWHY\u201d you were not successful in a particular job search and to use that information to make changes and improvements in your approach. This might involve analyzing the feedback you received from employers, assessing your job search strategy, and identifying areas where you can improve your skills or qualifications. In my case, I used this principle, especially in the technical interviews. When, during the technical interview, I was asked one theme of data engineering that I didn\u2019t know how to answer I went to study that theme for the next technical interview. I finished my Master\u2019s in Engineering in 2007, and only in 2017, I got my first good and stable engineering job. During those 10 years, I\u2019ve been unemployed, in a foreign country, working in a non-technical area, etc\u2026 You can see the history of my professional experience in my articleEvery Time I am Cleaning the Dishes I Remember Norway \u2026 If you read my article you may be thinking I am an optimistic and positive person but\u2026 \u201cAu Contraire My Friend\u201d, I am a very pessimistic person and always with negative thoughts but I amnot a quitter!! \ud83d\ude01I was able to achieve my current position because I was very persistent, I had to be patient and resilient. Resilience and persistence are important when looking for a new job because the process can be challenging and unpredictable. It will be common for you to face rejection or to have to apply to many jobs before finding the right fit. Being resilient can help you stay motivated and keep trying, even when faced with setbacks. Overall, being resilient and persistent can be a valuable asset in the job search process and in your career."
